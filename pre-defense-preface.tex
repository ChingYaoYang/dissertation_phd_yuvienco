\section*{Preface}

Thank you for participating in the evaluation of my dissertation. As you, the
reader and committee member, may be unaware of the salient details regarding my
progress to-date, I impart this brief preface.  The work
documented in this pre-defense draft of my dissertation is entitled:
\hspace{0pt}\\
\hspace{0pt}\\
\emph{Modulation of the Physicochemical Properties of Block Protein Copolymers
via Fluorination and the Adaptation of Coiled-coil Proteins for Small Molecule
Delivery Applications}.
\hspace{0pt}\\
\hspace{0pt}\\
This thesis documents two separate but related efforts that have spanned the
last 4 years pertaining to:
   
\begin{enumerate}

    \item The incorporation of a fluorinated non-natural amino acid into a
        protein block co-polymer consisting of elastin-like peptide and
        coiled-coil domains, and the resultant effects on on its physicochemical
        properties, including secondary structure and emergent mechanical
        properties.

    \item The adaptation of the coiled-coil domain of the cartilage oligomeric
        matrix protein to the delivery of a retinoid inverse agonist, a
        therapeutic candidate for the treatment of osteoarthritis

\end{enumerate}
The first branch of work was peer-reviewed and published in 2012 in the
journal \emph{Biomacromolecules}. The second project is still underway and will
conclude during Spring 2014 in close collaboration with the NYU Hospital for
Joint Diseases. In addition to these works, an additional chapter on my short
work on the particle characterization of various novel transfection
reagent formulations, developed by Dr. Seiichi Yamano (NYU College of
Dentistry), will be amended to final copy of the dissertation.

Thank you very much again, and I sincerely welcome any editorial comments you
may have in the coming future, as well as our pre-defense meeting on the
afternoon of Wednesday, April 9th.
