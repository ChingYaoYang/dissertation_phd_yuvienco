global fluorinated amino acid incorporation}

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Protein-based materials}

% Introduce proteins as materials - a sort of history survey of bio-based
% functional material and their corresponding various application fields.

Genetically engineered proteins have made a significant impact in biomaterials
research, enabling the fabrication of polymers with monodisperse molecular
weights, a diverse set of side chain functionality, and well-defined secondary
structure elements.\cite{
Yoshikawa1994,Wang2001,Rabotyagova2009,Martin2009,Dinerman2002,Megeed2002,Haider2004,Wright2002,Banta2010,Link2003,Straley2009,Rabotyagova2011}

\begin{figure}[h!] \centering \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{f_1_03}
    \caption[The predominant methodologies of protein
        engineering.]{The predominant methodologies of protein
        engineering.\cite{VanHest2001}}\label{fig:protein_engineering_methods} \end{figure}
% --------------------------
Compared against a backdrop of predominant synthetic polymers, protein polymers,
particularly those generated via high-fidelity recombinant DNA technologies,
exhibit defined molecular weight, composition, sequence, and
stereochemistry.\cite{VanHest2001} While proteins are not alone amongst
engineered materials of biological origin, they exist as the intersection of
biological function and structure. The latter feature spans the gamut of length
scales, ranging from the nanoscopic to the macroscopic, with notable examples
including actin filaments in the intracellular milieu to the silk fibers visible
to the naked eye.\cite{Rabotyagova2009,Megeed2002,Nagarsekar2002} Their frequent
roles as both sensors and chemical catalysts are testaments to their functional
impact on nature.

% Begin to focus on example of proteins that have secondary structural motifs
% that abstract themselves to higher order structures, such as fibers.
% Generalize how these can span length scales from nanoscopic order to
% macroscopic order.  Why do these higher order structures typically form. 

Numerous examples exist of proteins extrapolating the assembly process beyond
the quaternary scale of folding. This arena of self-assembly is of particular
focus herein, requiring inquiry into the evidence of such phenomenon occurring,
and more importantly, how these self-assembly events occur mechanistically.

In the case of collagen, secondary structure is established as alpha-helices but
further progresses to the self-association of monomers to form triple helices.
More interestingly, this tiered assembly, wherein the larger macromolecular
assemblies become dependent on the secondary structure of monomers imbues the
opportunity for sequence-dependent specificity of assemblies. Indeed this
inherent feature of these self-assembling systems has been leveraged by several
engineering design groups.\cite{}

Similarly, resilin, the proteinaceous material responsible for the elasticity of
various insect wings and appendages, relies on a critical proline residue to
accommodate regular turns in the protein backbone that promote a molecular
spring able to survive innumerable duty cycles.\cite{}

In the case of elastin-based peptides, secondary structure is established as a
preliminary phase of assembly. The prominent theory in the field dictates that
the higher order self-assembly of these class of peptides is governed by the
hydrophobic collapse of the macromolecule. In certain cases, this results in a
macroscopic network of peptides to yield either a gel or colloid of
coacervates.\cite{}

Silk is another prominent natural protein on which novel biomaterial design is
based. It exists as an example of a heterogeneous mixture of structured and
unstructured secondary structures.  $\beta$-sheets dominate the ordered features
of silk variants.

\subsection{Incorporation of non-natural amino acids}

While the physicochemical properties of protein-based materials have been
modulated with extraordinary capacity and range\cite{} - in large part due to
the non-covalent interplay of amino acid residues - they are still limited by
the constrained 22 amino acids that define functional group diversity.\cite{}
This limitation has been addressed, and in many ways deprecated, by various
efforts in genetic engineering.\cite{} 

There exists two contemporary methods to biosynthetically incorporate
non-natural amino acids into proteins: site-specific incorporation and
residue-specific incorporation.

\subsubsection{Site-specific incorporation methods} 

% Document the example of site-specific incorporation of azido-containing amino
% acids into polypeptides.

Early work in the mechanistic studies, and resultant ``hacking'' of the
components of the natural protein synthesis machinery, yielded the eventual
maturity of incorporation techniques.  Site-specific incorporation has been a
viable strategy for the incorporation of non-natural amino acids into
polypeptides since the late 1990's, yet its development stemmed from
advancements occurring as early as the late 1970's, with the work of Sidney
Hecht on the chemical aminoacylation of tRNA and subsequent work on the
misacylation of tRNA{$^\text{Phe}$}.\cite{Heckler1984,Hecht1978} This later
fostered incremental efforts of Brunner in the charging of tRNA{$\text{Phe}$}
with \iupac{\L-4'-[3-(trifluoromethyl)-3\H-diazirin-3-yl]}phenylalanine, which
still required the chemically misaminoacylation of tRNA in the presence of T4
RNA ligase and ATP.\cite{Baldini1988}
% --------------------------
\begin{figure}[h!] \centering \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{f_1_05}
    \caption[Strategy for the site-specific incorporation of unnatural amino
    acids.]{Strategy for the site-specific incorporation of unnatural amino
    acids.\cite{Noren1989}}\label{fig:schultz_schema} \end{figure}
% --------------------------
With the seminal efforts of the Schultz \latin{et al.}\cite{Noren1989} shortly
following these earlier bodies of work, it is now possible to redefine the
genetic code. 
% --------------------------
Years later, in 2001, the Schultz group reported on the development of a unique
transfer RNA (tRNA)/aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase pair that were genetically
engineered to exist as orthongal complments to their endogenous analogues, as
well as associate the encoding for the amber nonsense codon with a non-natural
amino acid - \iupac{\ortho-methyl-\L-tyrosine}. The group was able to thus
incorporate a non-natural, synthetic amino acid with notably high fidelity
(99\%).\cite{Wang2001} This method relies on the translation suppression of
endogenous amber nonsense codons, which is addressed by the orthogonal nature of
the system's design. Similarly, Kwon and coworkers have been able to reassign
one of the degenerate codons (UUU) that correspond to phenylalanine to encode
for \iupac{2-naphthylalanine}.\cite{Kwon2003}

This technique has been employed in various contexts, ranging from the study of
the structure-function relationship of enzymes and receptors, to the rationale
design of proteins with higher activities or structural stabilities.
%How site-specific incorporation has been used to probe structure-function
%relationships

%How site-specific incorporation has been used to rationally design proteins

%Other groups have pushed the envelope still further with this technique,
%reimagining the genetic code itself.

\subsubsection{Global incorporation methods} 

% Include an argument in support of residue-specific incorporation via
% endogenous tRNA/aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase

Global incorporation of non-natural amino acids is further made possible by the
particular technique of residue-specific substitution. This technique is
typically characterized by a stochastic substitution of all amino acids of a
particular identity within a given sequence. It is made possible by two
prominent factors: 1) the promiscuity and relaxed specificity of aminoacyl-tRNA
synthetase endogenous to certain expression hosts, and 2) the existence of
auxotrophic expression hosts.

\subsection{Fluorinated amino acids}

% What's the earliest precedence found for fluorinated amino acids and the
% motivation behind their synthesis?


\subsection{Fluorous effect}

The lazy brown fox.

\subsection{Scope of work}

The primary goals of this work were to evaluate the incorporation of
the fluorinated amino acid, \iupac{\para-fluorophenylalanine}, into protein block
copolymers that were previously developed, and to evaluate the effects of this
incorporation on the physicochemical properties of the polymers.
% --------------------------
It is hypothesized that the substitution of fluorine onto the guest residue of
the elastin-like peptide block sequence will significantly affect the behavior
of the bulk polymer, supported by the current understanding of elatin-like
peptides, elastin-like peptide fusions, and precedent observations of
fluorinated biomacromolecules.

% Reference the particular of the following works in an effort to draft a
% rational hypothesis of what will happen upon incorporation. Then justify why
% CD, turbidity, and microrheology is used to interrogate these effects.
% vide supra List
% Guest residue effects by Urry.
% Chilkoti's block influence work.
% Fluorous effect.

To probe the effects on the physicochemical behavior of these block copolymers,
three primary experiments were conducted, spanning various scales of structure -
circular dichroism spectroscopy, UV/Vis spectroscopy, and microrheology.
Circular dichroism was implemented in order to interrogate the effects of
incorporation on the secondary structure of the fusion proteins as a function of
temperature, thereby probing the affects of \emph{p}FF on the transitional
nature of the protein. UV/Vis spectroscopy was implemented to roughly quantify
the extent of macroscopic assembly occurring as a result of temperature-induced
transitions, the mechanical nature of which was probed by microrheology. 

\subsubsection{Circular Dichroism} Circular dichroism has been used extensively
in the investigation of proteins, providing a relatively rapid method for
structure elucidation with minimal sample requirements (i.e. mass, volume,
concentration, and matrix). It lacks the capacity, however, for exact structural
determination, which has become readily possible amongst a myriad of classes of
proteins via high resolution NMR and X-ray diffraction analysis.\cite{Adler1973}
Nevertheless, circular dichroism has been utilized to fingerprint protein
secondary structure since the 1960's, including one of the foundational studies
on \iupac{poly-\L-lysine} by Norma Greenfield.\cite{Greenfield1969} The method
of analysis has continued to mature across decades of application to various
biomolecules, yielding advancements in the computationally-aided deconvolution
of
spectra,\cite{Andrade1993,Sreerama1993,Manavalan1987,Provencher1981,Johnson1999}
and expansion into the far-UV region of CD
spectroscopy.\cite{Brahms1980,Wallace2009,Miles2006} It is a technique of
particular relevance as it has been applied extensively to both classes of
blocks of the block copolymers investigated in this work, providing a nominal
reference structures on which to base the interpretation of structural
alterations. Variants of the elastin-like peptide have undergone extensive CD
spectroscopic characterization, including investigations on the affects of motif
pattern modifications,\cite{Nuhn2008,Kim2005} solvent conditions,\cite{URRY1974}
as well as polymer length.\cite{Nuhn2008,Urry1986,Reiersen1998} While the larger
cartilage-oligomeric matrix protein has not been extensively studied for its
secondary structure via CD spectroscopy, its coiled-coil region has been
isolated and studied for its secondary structural conformation with CD
spectroscopy.\cite{Gunasekar2009,Terskikh1997} More recently, the natively
constructed block copolymers themselves were characterized with CD
spectroscopy.\cite{Haghpanah2009}

\subsubsection{UV/Vis spectroscopy}
It has long been the convention to monitor the coacervation of materials that
demonstrate a lower critical
solution temperature point via their temperature-resolved absorption in the
range of \SIrange{300}{400}{\nm}.
The LCST was defined as half-maximal turbidity.\cite{Urry1993}

\subsubsection{Microrheology}
While several methods exist to evaluate the mechanical properties of fluids,
colloidal suspensions, and polymeric gels, microrheological techniques are
necessary to evaluate samples that are limited in volume and material
homogeneity. Classical oscillatory plate and capillary cell rheometers could not
accommodate the anticipated nature of block protein polymers, with expectedly
low viscoelastic moduli and low response frequencies. Micorheological methods,
however, could be employed to observe the mechanical properties of dilute
supramolecular assemblies. These methods include the application
fluctuation-dissipation theorem-based (FDT)
microrheology,\cite{Gittes1997,Mason1997,Mason1997a} two-point microrheology
(TPM),\cite{Crocker2000,Levine2000,Qiu2004,Levine2001} and atomic force
spectroscopy.\cite{Salman2002,Caspi2002} Herein, we employ a form of FDT-based
microrheology, which may be accomplished via a myriad of instrumental
techniques, including laser-deflection tracking,\cite{Gittes1997,Mason1997}
optical tweezers,\cite{Starrs2003,Addas2004} dynamic light
scattering,\cite{Dasgupta2002,Popescu2002} and image-based particle
tracking\cite{Valentine2004,Crocker2000,Chen2003}- all methods toward an effort
to quantify the Brownian motion of particles suspended in the rheological fluid
of interest.

The particular application of particle tracking documented herein is based on
the work and source code distributed by Weitz and Mason for particle tracking
microrheology of complex fluids.\cite{Mason1997} The technique assumes a
homogeneous isotropic solution in which an ensemble of spherical particles are
suspended, and the motion of which is primarily governed by the Brownian motion
within the medium.  The technique further assumes that the continuum medium is
incompressible. Given these assumptions, the technique relates the viscoelastic
spectrum of the fluid medium, ${\tilde{G}(s)}$, to the unilateral Laplace
transform of the mean square displacement, ${\langle \Delta r^2(t) \rangle}$, of
the particles, via the Stokes-Einstein equation:

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:stokes-einstein}
    \tilde{G}(s)=
    \frac{k_BT}{\pi a s \langle \Delta \tilde{r}^2(s) \rangle}
    \text{ (units : \si{\pascal})}
\end{equation}

where ${s}$ is the Laplace frequency and ${k_B}$ is the Boltzmann's constant. In
this work, ${\tilde{G}(s)}$ was computed from ${\Delta r^2(t)}$ obtained via
image-based particle tracking, \latin{vide infra}.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Recombinant gene construction}

Plasmid vectors containing the genes for the block protein polymer fusions were
created in a modular fashion, described in a previously accomplished body of
work.\cite{Haghpanah2009} Briefly, PCR assembly of the COMP gene and
flanking linker regions yielded a pQE9 vector (Qiagen) contianing the final
single block construct. This was then digested with SalI and SacI restriction
enzymes, and gel purified for insertion into a pQE30 plasmid vector, yielding
pQE30/C. 

The 5-repeat elastin gene was PCR amplified from pUC19RGDELF, donated by David
Tirrell, and cloned into pQE30/C between various restriction sites, to yield
pQE30/EC (BamHI and SacI), pQE30/CE (SalI and HindIII), and pQE30/ECE (all 4
sites).

\subsection{Biosynthesis}

The aforementioned plasmid vectors were transformed into the phenylalanine
auxotrophic \emph{E. coli} strain AF-IQ, previously created and donated by David
Tirrell \emph{et al}.\cite{Yoshikawa1994,} Cells growth methods were based on
previously established conditions for the incorporation of unnatural amino
acids, particularly pFF, into target
proteins.\cite{Voloshchuk2009,Yoshikawa1994}

Plasmids were transformed into AF-IQ cells via electroporation using the
following parameters on an electroporator (BioRad, Inc.) The cells were then
plated onto a tryptic soy agar plate, 40
\si{\g\per\L},
supplemented with ampicillin (200 
\si{\ug\per\mL})
and chloramphenicol (35
\si{\ug\per\mL}), and
allowed to grow overnight at 37 \si{\celsius}. Single colonies were then picked
and used to inoculate starter cultures, grown in M9 minimal media, supplemented
with the following components:

\end{tabular}
\caption{Pre-induction M9 Supplement Specifications}
\label{tab:preinduction_recipe}
\end{table}
%END_TABLE

Cells were grown in M9 supplemented media in two stages - a pre-induction stage
and a post-induction stage - which are separated by a media shift step.  The
starter culture was used to inoculate a larger \SI{100}{\mL} culture, as
\SI{4}{\volper}, grown in pre-induction M9 media as per Table
\ref{tab:preinduction_recipe}.  The culture was then allowed to grow in a
\SI{1}{\L} flask for \SI{6}{\hour} at \SI{37}{\celsius}, shaking at
\SI{350}{\rpm}. The culture was subsequently harvested and pelleted via
centrifugation. The pellet was subjected to resuspension in a volumetric
equivalent of \SI{0.9}{\wtper} NaCl solution, followed by centrifugation.  This
``wash'' step was performed 2 times in an effort to deplete the media of
residual amounts of extracellular phenylalanine. The washed pellet was
resuspended in fresh M9 supplemented media.  The distinct difference between the
pre- and post-induction supplemental reagents pertain to the amino acids
constitution; the post-induction media does not contain phenylalanine, but
rather contains \SI{91.59}{\mg\per\mL} \iupac{\para-fluorophenylalanine},
prepared from a stock.  Cells in the new media were allowed to grow at the same
incubation conditions for \SI{30}{\minute}, at which time the media was
supplemented with \iupac{isopropyl \b-\D-1-thiogalactopyranoside} (IPTG,
\SI{100}{\ug\per\mL}).  Cells were harvested and stored at -20 \si{\celsius} for
subsequent lysis and purification.

\subsection{Protein purification}

All solutions used in the extraction and purification of recombinant proteins
were filtered through \SI{0.22}{\um} sterile filters. In addition, all solutions
were adjusted to the appropriate \pH with either \SI{37}{\percent} \ch{HCl} or
\SI{1}{\moLar} \ch{NaOH}. Cell pellets were thawed at \SI{4}{\celsius} and
immediately subected to an osmotic shock protocol adapted from methods set forth
by Berglund \emph{et al}.  for the preparation of cell lysate for immobilized
metal affinity chromatography (IMAC)
purification.\cite{Neu1965,Bae2000,Magnusdottir2009} Briefly, cells were gently
resuspended in a cold hypertonic sucrose solution, consisting of
\SI{50}{\milli\moLar} HEPES, \SI{20}{\wtper} sucrose, \SI{1}{\milli\moLar}
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), \pH 7.9. For every \SI{10}{\mL} of
original culture media, the resultant pellet was resuspended in \SI{1}{\mL} of
sucrose solution. The cell suspension was then pelleted via centrifugation at
\SI{7000}{\gforce} for \SI{30}{\minute} at \SI{4}{\celsius}. The resultant
pellet was separated from its supernatant and gently resuspended in a cold
hypotonic solution consisting of \SI{5}{\milli\moLar} \ch{MgSO4}, with a
volumetric equivalent to that of the previous step, and incubated on ice for
\SI{10}{\minute}. The suspension was then centrifuged at \SI{4500}{\gforce} for
\SI{20}{\minute} at \SI{4}{\celsius}. The resultant pellet was separated from
its supernatant and stored at \SI{-20}{\celsius} for downstream lysis. 

Osmotically shocked expression pellets were resuspended in denaturing lysis
buffer, consisting of \SI{50}{\milli\moLar} \ch{Na2HPO4}, \SI{6}{\moLar}
\ch{CO(NH2)2}, \pH 8.0. The pellet was resuspended in a 4:70 volumetric ratio
(buffer:culture volume) on ice. The cell lysate was then passed through a French
press (40K-cell; Thermo Scientific), processed at \SI{165.5}{\MPa}, and
collected on ice. The cold lysate was then centrifuged at \SI{40000}{\gforce}
for \SI{45}{\minute} at \SI{4}{\celsius}. The clarified lysate was then applied
to a \SI{5}{\mL} HiTrap IMAC FastFlow column (GE Life Sciences), charged with
\ch{CoCl2}, using an \"{A}KTA purifier system (GE Life Sciences). The lysate was
loaded with \SI{0}{\moLar} imidazole and washed with 10 column volumes (CV) of
the same buffer constitution. The protein was then eluted across 1 CV of
\SI{48}{\milli\moLar} imidazole and 3 CV of \SI{1}{\moLar} imidazole.  Purified
elutions were assayed for purity via sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis and, contingent upon confirmation of
\SI{90}{\percent} purity, was dialyzed extensively against water with a 3500
MWCO regenerated cellulose membrane (SnakeSkin Dialysis Tubing, Pierce) and
subsequently freeze-dried prior to use in experiments. Polyacrylamide gels were
cast using ammonium persulfate and tetramethylethylenediamine-catalyzed
polymerization to obtain \SI{12}{\wtper} acrylamide gels. Gel lanes of pure
protein were used to quantitate post-purification yields, using an ImageQuant
gel imaging system (GE Life Sciences). Loaded mass of protein, from
\SI{10}{\uL}, was calibrated against a volumetric equivalent of Precision Plus
Protein Unstained Standard mixture (Bio-Rad).

\subsection{Compositional characterization}
\subsubsection{MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry}

Incorporation levels of pFF were assessed via matrix-assisted laser desorption
ionization, time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis on an Omniflex
spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics). Chymotryptic digests of purified proteins were
prepared by resuspending \SIrange[range-phrase=--]{50}{100}{\ug} of protein in
\SI{100}{\milli\moLar} Tris-HCl and \SI{10}{\milli\moLar} \ch{CaCl2} (\pH 8.0)
to a final concentration of \SI{1.25}{\ug\per\uL}. Sequencing grade chymotrypsin
(Promega) was added to the mixture to yield a final concentration of
\SI{2}{\wtperwt}. The digestion reaction was allowed to occur at \SI{25}{\celsius}
for \SI{20}{\hour} and subsequently stopped by adjusting the mixture to \pH 4 by
titrating with \SI{1}{\percent} trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). The protein digest
mixtures were desalted and concentrated by using ZipTip(\ch{C18}) silica resin
(Millipore).  Desalted sample mixtures were mixed with saturated solutions of
\iupac{\a-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid} prepared in \SI{1}{\percent}
TFA/acetonitrile (2:1) in a 1:1 ratio. Samples were then spotted onto a 7x7
OmniFlex MALDI target (Bruker Daltonics) and allowed to dry under vacuum.
Relative estimates of peptide digest fragment quantities were conducted by
comparing relative peak intensities at different \emph{m/z} values. MS spectra
were calibrated against a standard mixture of peptides, provided by New England
Biolabs, consisting of \ldots

\subsubsection{Amino acid analysis}

Amino acid analysis was performed on purified protein samples that have
undergone hydrolysis. Hydrolysate samples were then analyzed on a Hitachi L-8900
pH amino acid analyzer at the W. M. Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource
Laboratory at Yale University. Incorporation levels of pFF were calculated based
on the measurements of normalized Phe levels in the samples.

\subsection{Physicochemical characterization}

\subsubsection{UV/Vis spectroscopy}

UV/vis spectroscopy was performed on a Cary 100 UV/vis spectrometer (Agilent) to
determine the inverse temperature transition point ({$T_t$}) of 
\SI{4}{\micro\moLar} protein prepared in \SI{10}{\milli\moLar} Gomori buffer,
\pH 8.0. The absorbance at \SI{350}{\nm} was measured as each protein sample was
heated from \SIrange{10}{65}{\celsius}, at a heating rate of
\SI{0.5}{\celsius\per\minute}.\cite{Chilkoti2002a}

\subsubsection{Circular dichroism spectroscopy}

Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy was carried out on a J-815 CD polarimeter
(Jasco) equipped with a PTC-423S single position Peltier temperature control
system and cuvette holder, counter-cooled with an Isotemp 3016S water bath
(Fisher Scientific) set to \SI{22}{\celsius}. Protein samples were prepared to
\SI{4}{\micro\moLar} in \SI{10}{\milli\moLar} Gomori buffer, by resuspending
lyophilized protein and loading into a Helma 218 quartz cuvette (\SI{500}{\uL}
capacity, \SI{1}{mm} path length). Immediately prior to loading into the
spectrometer, samples were degassed for \SI{10}{\minute} by sparging samples
with nitrogen. Operation and analysis parameters were adapted from existing
procedures.\cite{Haghpanah2009} Wavelength scans were performed while holding
temperature constant as the samples were heated from \SIrange{10}{65}{\celsius},
at a heating rate of \SI{1}{\celsius\per\minute}.  Wavelength scans were
performed from \SIrange{250}{190}{\nm} with a \SI{1}{\nm} step size. Wavelength
scans were collected as the average of 3 consecutive scans, with a preliminary
equilibration time of \SI{5}{\minute} prior to the first scan. All wavelength
scans were subtracted from the background of Gomori buffer.

Mean residue ellipticity, $[\theta]_{\mathrm{mrw}}$ was calculated from
expression \ref{eq:mre} below:

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:mre}
    [\theta]_{\text{mrw}}=
    \frac{[\theta]_{\text{obs}}\cdot\text{MRW}}{10\cdot{C_\text{mg/mL}}\cdot{L}}
    \text{ (units : \si{\degtext\cm\squared\per\deci\mol})}
\end{equation}

where $[\theta]_{\text{obs}}$ is the observed ellipticity signal, MRW is the
mean residue weight (molecular weight divided by the number of residues), $L$ is
the path length of the cell (in cm), and $C_\text{mg/mL}$ is the protein's
concentration.\cite{Martin2008} MRE spectral data was smoothed using a
Savitsky-Golay low-pass filter, applied with SpectraManager software package (Jasco),
using a smoothing width of 25. Estimation of secondary structure was performed
computationally using the CDSSTR method, as distributed by DICHROWEB (Birkbeck
College of the University of London). The method was applied with the SDP49
protein reference set.
\subsubsection{Microrheology}

To interrogate the mechanical properties of the proteins, passive microrheology
was performed using an inverted Leica DM-138 IRB microscope with a 20$\times$
objective lens at \SI{22}{\celsius} and \SI{42}{\celsius}, maintained by a
Linkam temperature-controlled microscope stage. Samples were prepared from
lyophilized proteins by dissolving dry powder in deionized water at
\SI{4}{\celsius} to two concentrations, \SI{1.25}{\mg\per\mL} and
\SI{2.5}{\mg\per\mL}. \SI{2}{\uL} of a \SI{2}{\wtper} stock of
fluorescently-labeled amidated polystyrene beads (\SI{1.0}{\um} was added to
\SI{10}{\uL} samples of protein. Brownian motion of the beads was observed by a
Peltier-cooled video camera (QiCam) and digitally recorded.  Mean square
displacement (MSD) measurements of the beads, dispersed in the protein sol gels,
were determined using IDL software (Research Systems, Inc.) and an application
of microrheological processing subroutines set forth by Mason and
Weitz.\cite{Mason1997} The subroutines as well as the parameters which they are
fed, are documented in Appendix B. 

\section{Results}

\subsection{Biosynthesis of Fluorinated Block Polymers}

Residue-specific incorporation of pFF was accomplished using previously
established techniques by the Montclare Group, and previously by the Tirrell
Group.\cite{Yoshikawa1994,Sharma2000,Voloshchuk2009} Three primary methods of
incorporation analysis were conventionally practiced at the time of this work:
SDS-PAGE, amino acid analysis (AAA), and mass spectrometry (MS). 
%Cite comparative works that use this overall approach of 3 methods.
This regimen of analysis for incorporation of non-natural amino acids has been
recently implemented by Montclare, Baker, and
Voloshchuk\cite{Voloshchuk2009,Panchenko2006,Baker2011}. In
addition, several groups have implemented AAA as part of their evaluation of novel
peptides. MALDI-MS, due to its limited quantitative capacity, has been
implemented to a lesser extent, but still has been employed in some
studies.\cite{Taki2001}

SDS-PAGE analysis of \emph{E.coli} expression lysate samples were carried out to
confirm proper control of induction via the \emph{lac} operon of the pQE-30
expression vector, as well as the suppression of significant amounts of protein
expression in the absence of \iupac{phenylalanine}.  Figure
\ref{fig:expression_gel_pFF} indicates the sufficient control of expression so
as to achieve effectively sole incorporation of \emph{p}FF. The absence of
expression in the absence of IPTG and the absence of either Phe or \emph{p}FF
suggests a tight control of the inducible expression system. This is consistent
with the complementary design of the expression host/vector pairing - AF-IQ and
pQE-30 - of this implementation.

More specifically, in the presence of Phe or \emph{p}FF, a distinct band was
observed at \SI{25}{\kilo\dalton} for the diblocks and \SI{37}{\kilo\dalton} for
the triblock, confirming the production of protein polymers. Similar results
were obtained from previous studies, of equivalent differentials in band
intensities so as to conclude suppression of expression.

AAA and MS serve as orthogonal means to assess incorporation, with each method
providing its own merits and succumbing to its respective limitations. While AAA
provides high-fidelity quantitation of the amino acid composition of a protein,
it comes at the expense of complete hydrolysis of the sample and resultant loss
of primary sequence information. MS of enzymatic-digest fragments of the
protein, on the other hand, may only be considered quasi-quantitative under the
assumption of equivalent propensities of fragments to ionize, despite the
difference in primary structure and molecular weight; however, under this
assumption, it may be used to elucidate the relative incorporation levels of a
non-natural amino acid across different segments of the protein, allowing the
researcher to conclude an homogeneous dispensation of non-natural amino acid
throughout the primary sequence of the protein.

MALDI-ToF analysis of chymotryptic digests of each of the proteins was carried
out. Figures \ref{fig:MALDI_spectrum_EC}, \ref{fig:MALDI_spectrum_CE}, and
\ref{fig:MALDI_spectrum_ECE} delineate the main two fragments that result from
chymotrypsin digestion, which cleaves the protein at Phe residues.
Fortuitously, the enzyme appears to easily cleave sites that display \emph{p}FF
as well as Phe. Each spectrum indicates a shift in mass-to-charge ratio that
results from the shift imparted by an additional \SI{18}{\dalton}. Four regions
of interest on the MS spectra are highlighted, indicating expected fragments
from the digestion reaction, three of which derive from the COMP domain, and one
of which is the degenerate fragment of the elastin-like peptide domain.

%Implications of incomplete incorporation

\subsection{Secondary Structural Anaylsis}
CD spectroscopic wavelength scans were obtained for all three fluorinated
proteins and compared against previously collected spectra for wild-type
variants of the protein polymers, show in Figure
\ref{fig:CD_temp_wl}.\cite{Haghpanah2009} 

Figure \ref{fig:CD_temp_wl}A suggests the \emph{p}FF-EC is randomly structured
at low temperatures, transitioning to an ${\alpha+\beta}$-rich conformation  at
higher temperatures. By contrast, \emph{p}FF-CE revealed a more structured
${\alpha+\beta}$ conformation at temperatures less than \SI{30}{\celsius}. Upon
heating from \SIrange{30}{50}{\celsius}, \emph{p}FF-CE adopted a predominantly
${\beta}$-rich structure indicated by a single minimum present above
\SI{220}{\nm}. \emph{p}FF-ECE revealed a highly cooperative transition from a
randomly structured protein to a ${\beta}$-rich protein (indicated by a single
minimum at \SI{30}{\celsius}), eventually losing all evidence of structure. The
secondary structures depend on the orientation of the block segments and the
number of the block segments, consistent with the behavior of the wild-type 
proteins.\cite{Haghpanah2009} While both fluorinated diblocks appeared to
exhibit minimal deviation in structure relative to their wild-type analogues,
pFF-ECE only resembled its wild-type counterpart at lower temperatures and
conformed to a ${\beta}$-rich structure at higher temperatures. The wild-type
ECE spectra demonstrated an isodichroic point, conventionally indicative of a
two-state transition, a feature clearly absent in the pFF-ECE spectra
collection.

\subsection{Thermoresponsive Supramolecular Assembly}
The effect of temperature on the supramolecular assembly of the proteins was
examined via absorption at \SI{350}{\nm}. The inverse temperature transition
(${T_t}$) was determined via, temperature-dependent absorption, shown in Figure
\ref{fig:lcst}, consistent with conventional techniques in studying coacervation
phenomena of elastin-like peptides.\cite{Urry1985} While this technique is more
commonly used to quantify the turbidity of solutions of coacervates, previous
work on these block polymers used the more resolved techniques of dynamic and
static light scattering in order to obtain size distribution profiles for each
of the proteins during their thermoresponsive transitions. However, this work
details the first application of simple turbidity measurements to the
wild-type, in addition to the \emph{p}FF-incorporated variants of block polymers.

In comparison to previously reported results, obtained via dynamic light
scattering, turbidity measurements provided evidence of thermoresponsive
transitions occurring for wild-type proteins in the same range about
\SI{25}{\celsius}, with the onset of transitions occurring close to
\SI{20}{\celsius} for all wild-type proteins (see black curves in Figure 
\ref{fig:lcst}). However, as is evident from turbidity, the process continues
to intensify with respect to absorption, in contrast to the previously obtained
DLS results, which indicated single particle size distributions (for the EC and
ECE proteins) beyond \SI{20}{\celsius} with no further information regarding the
cooperativity of the transition.

The ${T_t}$ values for all fluorinated block polymers were different, affirming
the significance of block orientation and number, consistent with the primary
conclusions drafted previously for the wild-type
variants.\cite{Haghpanah2010,Haghpanah2009} The ${T_t}$ of pFF-EC was determined
to be \SI{25}{\celsius}, while pFF-CE and pFF-ECE exhibited a ${T_t}$ at
\SI{28}{\celsius} and \SI{32}{\celsius}, respectively. In comparison to the
wild-type proteins, fluorination appeared to depress the ${T_t}$ of the CE
protein from \SIrange{36}{28}{\celsius}, consistent with the primary hypothesis
regarding the affects of fluorine substitution within the elastin-like peptide
guest residue. While fluorination did not appear to affect the ${T_t}$ of EC or
ECE proteins, an enhanced cooperativity was observed in the transition for ECE.

Charts d-f in Figure \ref{fig:lcst} indicate the first derivative charts of
turbidity profiles shown in charts a-c of the same figure. The maxima of each of
the first derivative curves was computed and corresponding temperatures reported
as ${T_t}$ points. The transition for pFF-ECE, however, did not conform to a
distinctly sigmoidal profile, nor did it demonstrate a distinguishable maximum
in its first derivative. As such, the ${T_t}$ was interpolated as the midpoint
of a linear fit, with endpoints delineated by the onset and plateau of
transition in Figure \ref{fig:LCST_ECEpFF}.

\subsection{Mechanical Behavior}

Bulk rheological of the protein polymers were evaluated by microrheology, shown
in Figure \ref{fig:pFF_rheology}. Previous work by both the Tirrell and Chilkoti
groups have demonstrated the concentration-dependence of elastin-like peptide
self-assembly.\cite{Meyer2004,Yamaoka2003} Indeed, wt-EC was predominantly
viscous at concentrations below \SI{2.5}{\mg\per\mL} and transitioned to an
elastic network as the concentration was prepared to \SI{10}{\mg\per\mL}, shown
in Figure \ref{fig:wt_rheology}.\cite{Haghpanah2010} This behavior, however was
not observed for wt-CE and wt-ECE as they existed as predominantly viscous or
viscoelastic suspensions up to \SI{10}{\mg\per\mL}, respectively.

% --------------------------
Upon fluorination, more depressed concentration-dependent percolation points for
the protein polymers were observed. While wt-EC was predominantly viscous at
\SI{1.25}{\mg\per\mL}, pFF-EC was viscoelastic at \SI{22}{\celsius} at the same
concentration and both demonstrating more elastic character at \SI{42}{\celsius}
at \SI{2.5}{\mg\per\mL} (Figure \ref{fig:pFF_rheology}A,D
\ref{fig:wt_rheology}A,D). Both the wt-CE and pFF-CE exhibited
viscous/viscoelastic character at \SI{1.25}{\mg\per\mL} and \SI{2.5}{\mg\per\mL}
at \SI{22}{\celsius}, however, at \SI{2.5}{\mg\per\mL} and \SI{42}{\celsius},
pFF-CE demonstrated a dominant elastic modulus compared to the viscoelastic
character of the wt-CE (Figure \ref{fig:pFF_rheology}B,E and Figure
\ref{fig:wt_rheology}B,E). Two types of modifications to the rheology behavior
are observed from the EC and CE sets of constructs. For pFF-EC, a transition
shift in the required concentration to yield viscoelastic behavior is
demonstrated, whereas for pFF-CE, a rheological shift to elastic behavior was
observed, which was not obtainable, even at concentrations up to
\SI{10}{\mg\per\mL} for wt-CE.\cite{Haghpanah2010}

Similar to both diblocks, pFF-ECE underwent a transition and rheological shift.
pFF-ECE demonstrated a transition shift from viscous to viscoelastic fluid at
\SI{1.25}{\mg\per\mL} (Figure \ref{fig:pFF_rheology}C and Figure
\ref{fig:wt_rheology}C). Most significantly, pFF-ECE at
\SI{1.25}{\mg\per\mL} exhibited elastic network formation at
\SI{42}{\celsius}, while the wt-ECE was completely viscous under the same
concentration and temperature (Figure \ref{fig:pFF_rheology}C and Figure
\ref{fig:wt_rheology}C).
