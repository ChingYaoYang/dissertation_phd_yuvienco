\section{The cytotoxic effects of protein constructs}

    \caption{The effects of COMP and block copolymer protein constructs on the
        viability of MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts, assessed via the MTT assay method,
        \emph{n}=4. wt-CE, \emph{p}FF-CE, and COMP were prepared to a final
        concentration of \SI{200}{\ug\per\mL} and \emph{p}FF was prepared to a
        final concentration of \SI{0.8}{\ug\per\mL}.}\label{fig:mtt_results}
    \end{figure}
Cytotoxicity of the protein constructs were evaluated by
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrasodium bromide, MTT assay.
MC3T3-E1 proosteoblast cells (
\SI[scientific-notation=true,retain-unity-mantissa=true]{1e6}{\per\ml}) in
\SI{100}{\uL} of ${\alpha}$MEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with \SI{10}{\volper}
FBS were seeded in 96-well plates and incubated overnight. The
\SI{5}{\mg\per\mL} MTT reagent in PBS was added into the plates and incubated
for 4 h. After incubation, the medium was aspirated and dimethyl sulfoxide
(\SI{100}{\uL} per well) was added to stop the reaction. The optical density was
then quantified in a microplate reader, Synergy HT at \SI{570}{\nm} wavelength.
The percentage of cell viability was calculated by comparing the groups to
control cells, which did not contain any of the sample reagents. The results are
shown in Figure \ref{fig:mtt_results}. the majority of the constructs
demonstrate a statistically insignificant effect on the viability of cells as
compared to the control.
