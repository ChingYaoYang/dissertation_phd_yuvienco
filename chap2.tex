\subsection{Osteoarthritis}

\subsubsection{Pathology description}

Joint pain continues to plague the world's population, affecting an
estimated 27 million Americans alone and encumbering an economic burden of costs
(both direct and indirect) associated with osteoarthritis that exceeds \$60
billion annually.\cite{Brown} As cartilage demonstrates little tendency for
self-repair, injuries and trauma can further lead to cartilage degeneration and
secondary arthritis, despite the best current care of significant joint
injuries.\cite{Helmerhorst2014} These include injuries to articular cartilage,
anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), and meniscus injuries, contributing to the
accumulated risk of post-traumatic osteoarthritis of
\SIrange{20}{50}{\percent}.\cite{Roos1995,Anderson2011,Reiersen1998,Buckwalter2006}

        non-calcified region, as depicted in the
        diagram.\cite{Wieland2005}}\label{fig:bone_diagram_1} \end{figure}
% --------------------------
As there is no cure for post-traumatic osteoarthritis, with existing treatments
limited to pain management, the most common outcome is the replacement of the
affected area with joint construction and implantation of a prosthesis. Highly
physically active individuals, such as professional athletes and military
service members, are of particularly higher risk to heightened osteoarthritis
progression.\cite{Cameron2011} Unfortunately, there is a dearth of biological
and chemical compounds available for the treatment of post-traumatic
osteoarthritis. Thus, there exists a potential need for early detection
strategies and therapeutic targets to slow onset and progression.

Cartilage in joints acts as a firm visco-elastic tissue, covering the ends of
bones and acting as a smooth, gliding matrix and as a cushion between bones
(Figure \ref{fig:bone_diagram_1}).\cite{Wieland2005} It is a biomaterial composed
primarily of collagen fibers and aggrecans (aggregating chondroitin sulphate
proteoglycans), fostered by chondrocyte cells. In healthy cartilage tissue,
articular chondrocytes maintain a stable phenotype, balancing anabolic and
catabolic events, which results in the equilibrium condition of controlled
synthesis and degradation of extracellular matrix components.\cite{Sandell2001}
It is the disturbance of this equilibrium that has been established to be the
mechanism by which osteoarthritis occurs physiologically, resulting in the net
loss of extracellular matrix components key to cartilage function and integrity.
This has been attributed to both the lack of synthesis and increased levels of
proteases, but also has been ascribed to phenotypic changes in articular
chondrocytes, transitioning to a more hypertrophic
phenotype.\cite{Goldring2000,VanderKraan2012} Kirsch \latin{et al.} have
been among the first to report the loss of this phenotype and execution of
hypertrophic and terminal differentiation events,\cite{Kirsch2000} and this has
been verified among many other research
groups.\cite{Tchetina2007,Merz2003,Pfander2001,Davies2009} Figure
\ref{fig:OA_phenotype} shows the noted up- and down-regulated markers, given the
onset of induced osteoarthritis by \iupac{all-\trans-retinoic acid} (ATRA).

    \label{fig:OA_phenotype} \end{figure}
% --------------------------

Preliminary results collected by Kirsch echo the results of Davies, reinforcing
the theory that retinoic acid stimulates catabolic events and the hypertrophic
differentiation of chondrocytes in a dose-dependent manner (see Figure
\ref{fig:kirsch_prelim_results}A). Real-time PCR analysis of IL-6, MMP-13, and
alpha 1 type X collagen shows significant up-regulation of these markers,
suggesting that ATRA may have multiple effects on chondrocyte phenotype that are
relevant to the OA disease process. Preliminary unpublished data suggesting that
ATRA stimulates catabolic events in articular chondrocytes and further augments
these events in the presence of catabolic cytokines, such as interleukin-1-beta
(IL-1${\beta}$). The results in Figure \ref{fig:kirsch_prelim_results}B, also
collected by Kirsch, demonstrate that the known antagonists and inverse agonists
of the retinoic acid receptor family,\cite{DeLera2007} are capable of inhibiting
the expression of these markers to a limited extent.

    collagen. (B) mRNA levels of the catabolic marker MMP-13, in the presence of

    \SI{100}{\nano\moLar} operating as either RAR/RXR antagonists or inverse
    agonists.}

\subsubsection{The role of retinoids}

Retinoids, and specifically retinoic acids, are arguably the most potent forms
of vitamin A, participating in a broad range of physiological processes
including vision,\cite{Hyatt1996} cell growth and cancer,\cite{Mongan2007}
spermatogenesis,\cite{Vernet2006} inflammation,\cite{Huang2007} and
neural patterning.\cite{Abu-Abed2001}

Retinoids, specifically, \iupac{all-\trans-retinoic acid} (ATRA), and its role
as a regulator of cartilage and skeletal formation has been
established.\cite{Koyama1999} It has further been shown that retinoid signaling
can function in a bone morphogenic protein-independent manner to induce cartilage formation, which
are known to independently stimulate cartilage formation, and furthers the sole
influence of RARs.\cite{Weston2000} Specifically, it has been shown that ATRA is
a potent inducer of hypertrophic and terminal differentiation, as well as
specifically inducing the expression of certain matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)
and aggrecanases (ADAMTS), both predominantly responsible for the degradation of
the extracellular matrix at cartilage
sites.\cite{Wang2002,Iwamoto1994,Koyama1999,Johnson2003}

These studies have contributed to the ongoing hypothesis that increased ATRA
levels in osteoarthritis is a major contributor to osteoarthritis pathogenesis
because of ATRA's potential to induce hypertrophic differentiation, inflammatory
activity, increase protease expression, and perturb gene expression associated
with extracellular matrix components.

    \caption[Structural and functional architecture of the heterodimeric

        DBDs.\cite{DeLera2007}}\label{fig:retinoid_receptor_structures}
    \end{figure}
% --------------------------
The influence of ATRA and its analogues stems from their interactions with two
sub-families of nuclear receptor transcription factors involved in retinoid
signaling - retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and retinoid X receptors (RXRs). RARs
are further differentiated across three variants, RAR${\alpha}$, RAR${\beta}$,
and RAR${\gamma}$ receptors, all three of which are activated by
ATRA.\cite{Chambon1996} While growth plate chondrocytes are known to mainly
express RAR${\alpha}$ and RAR${\gamma}$,\cite{Koyama1999} little is known
regarding the expression of RARs amongst osteoarthritic and healthy articular
chondrocytes. RARs and RXRs interact with one another to form heterodimers,
facilitating ligand-dependent transcription with a myriad of discovered
participating cofactors (Figure \ref{fig:retinoid_receptor_structures}). RXRs, however,
can form ``permissive'' heterodimers with other nuclear receptors, whereby
RXR-selective ligands can activate transcription via the heterodimer on their
own; this is not the case with RAR/RXR heterodimers, viewed as
``non-permissive'', they require the binding of RAR ligands for activation to
occur and otherwise remain silent.\cite{Altucci2007} Activation subsequently
drives physical interactions with co-regulatory proteins (i.e. co-repressors and
co-activators), ultimately binding to retinoic acid response elements (RAREs)
located at promoter regions of target genes.\cite{Germain2002,DeLera2007}

\subsubsection{Retinoid analogs}

In a comprehensive review of the design of selective RAR and RXR modulators, de
Lera elegantly presents the schema for the modulation of RAR-RXR
communication by various ligands. This review aptly summarizes that ``the
allosteric conformational change induced by a ligand onto a nuclear receptor
does nothing but modulate its communication properties with the surrounding
microcosmos of signal adaptors.''\cite{DeLera2007} This applies to the retinoid
superfamily of receptors (Figure \ref{fig:RAR_communication}).
% --------------------------
\begin{figure}[h!] \centering \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{f_2_08}
    \caption[Ligand-driven communication between RAR and RXR
    receptors.]{Ligand-driven communication between RAR and RXR receptors.
        Homeostatic state is indicated by panel (a) wherein the RAR-RXR dimer
        exists with a co-repressor(CoR) bound to the RAR subunit. Upon RAR
        agonist activation, panel (b), the CoR binding interface is disrupted
        and offers a binding site for co-activator (CoA). RXR-selective agonist
        binding promotes the subsequent binding of CoA to sites on both of the
        receptors (c). (d) shows the case of RXR subordination, in which CoA
        cannot bind to the heterodimer. Further in the direction of repression,
        inverse agonists, such as BMS493, can stabilize the heterodimer-CoR
        complex (e). Neutral antagonists generate neither a surface to which CoR or
        CoA may bind. In less common cases, neutral antagonists can allow RXR
        agonists to recruit CoAs, resulting in partial activation.\cite{DeLera2007}}\label{fig:RAR_communication} \end{figure}
%This caption needs to be paraphrased from the DeLera paper.

Of specific relevance to the work presented herein is the inverse agonist,
BMS493 (\iupac{(\E)4-[2-[5,5-dimethyl
8-(2-phenylethynyl)-5,6-dihydronaphthalen-2-yl]ethen-1-yl]benzoic acid}), which
stabilizes the co-repressor/heterodimer complex, thus leading to enhanced
repression (Figure \ref{fig:RAR_communication}e).\cite{Germain2002} 

\subsection{Delivering small molecule therapeutics}

\subsubsection{Hurdles in the delivery of therapeutics}

The primary treatments of osteoarthritis set out to address its symptoms, with
the most common therapeutics being corticosteroids and hyaluronic
acid.\cite{Butoescu2009} Despite the numerous difficulties associated with
intra-articular injection of therapeutics (e.g. injection inaccuracies,
hyper-reactive inflammatory response of the synovium, and risks of bacterial
infection), the primary reason for failure is related to the rapid efflux of
drugs from the joint cavity.\cite{Ayral2001} This is a result of the
nature of the synovial surface that lines the joint cavity, consisting of a
discontinuous layer of synoviocytes with wide intercellular gaps measuring
\SIrange{0.1}{5.5}{\um} and no basement membrane, and which has been known since
1984.\cite{Knight1984} Due to the nature of the synovial ultrastructure, there
is a rapid flux of water and solutes in a joint cavity, in effect acting 
much like a dialysis chamber; small molecules (MW ${<}$ \SI{10000}{\dalton}) have
been shown to easily diffuse through the interstitium, applying an equilibrium
between the synovial fluid and plasma.\cite{Gerwin2006,Okuyama1984} Even with
hyaluronic acid injections, which comprise MW ranging from
\SIrange{2}{6}{\mega\dalton} and have reported half-lives up to \SI{24}{\hour},
the holy grail still remains obtaining sustained release on the order of days to
weeks.

\subsubsection{Drug delivery vehicles}

In the development of biochemical therapeutics, bioavailability has long been a
defining functional benchmark for many innovations in the field. The body's
reticuloendothelial system (RES), responsible for the efficient clearance of foreign
small molecules, is unfortunately too efficient at its task at size-excluding
therapeutic small molecules for subsequent excretion via the kidneys.
Bioavailability can be a function of compound solubility, \latin{in vivo}
half-life, therapeutic index, and immunogenicity, which all can affect the
available quantity of compound for its intended
destination.\cite{Petros2010,Davis2008,Shah1992}

Stemming from the long-held small molecule chemistry approach to therapy development,
many of the breakthroughs in the development of molecular ``vehicles'' to
increase bioavailability pertain to small molecules, both hydrophobic and
hydrophilic.\cite{Branco2009} Nanoparticle-based drug delivery, in particular, has been
approached from multiple material chemistries, including liposome, polymer, and
biopolymer-based delivery
vehicles.\cite{Branco2009,Iyer2006,Park2010,McDaniel2010}

The RES, under normal physiologic operation, removes nanoparticles via
a preliminary mechanical filtration step, accomplished by sinusoids in the
spleen.\cite{Moghimi2001} Residual nanoparticles are then typically removed via
the cells of the RES (i.e. macrophages), which is mediated by the opsonization
of the nanoparticles, which begins immediately upon introduction to plasma. The
protein adsorption that defines the opsonization process is still being
discovered, but the primary contributors are known to be immunoglobulin and
complement proteins.\cite{Petros2010} Particulate matter larger than ca.
\SI{15}{\um} is further removed via mechanical filtration in the
capillaries.\cite{Ilium1982} Particles less than \SI{5}{\nm} are typically
cleared from circulation via extravasation or renal clearance.\cite{Choi2007}

Many of these particle-based technologies
leverage the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, characteristic of
the body's size-exclusive execretory process via its reticuloendothelial
system.\cite{Matsumura1986,Fang2010} The EPR effect is credited to the
physiologic nature of the vasculature of tumor tissue, which tends to be
``leakier'' than healthy tissue, allowing for the mass transfer of larger
particles through the endothelium than would normally be permitted. Furthermore,
the lymphatic drainage of tumor tissue is not capable of draining particles
larger than some permitted through the leaky endothelium, the result of which
is a size cutoff window that allows for accumulation of nanoparticles at a site
of cancerous tissue (Figure \ref{fig:EPR_effect}).

\subsubsection{Mechanisms and strategies for enhancement of delivery}
% --------------------------
Enhanced delivery of small molecule therapeutics can be achieved via passive or
active targeting methods, when encapsulated or aided by a drug delivery vehicle.
Active targeting schemes typically involve the conjugation of ligands and/or
epitopes onto the vehicle, in addition to complexation with the therapeutic,
thus enabling receptor-mediated recognition and permanence.\cite{Singh2009} This
is in contrast to passive targeting methods, which predominantly refers to the
localization of therapeutic and/or delivery vehicle at the target site
via fluid flow and diffusion mechanisms; examples of this include therapeutics
delivered via the EPR effect or via direct infusion to the target
tissue.\cite{Singh2009}

Various materials have been applied toward the generation of nanoparticle
delivery systems, leveraging the EPR effect as well as active target moieties.
These include inorganic nanoparticle clusters,\cite{Thomas2003} organic
polymers,\cite{Yallapu2010b} lipids,\cite{Ranson1996}
proteins,\cite{Mackay2008} and polysaccharides.\cite{Stenekes2000} These types
of matter can further be defined by self-assembling archetypes, forming either
micelles, vesicles, or hydrogels.\cite{Branco2009}

Liposomes are poised as the most mature of the technologies, having been
successfully implemented to deliver various therapeutics stemming from their
ability to efficiently sequester small molecule
solutes.\cite{Ranson1996,Sessa1968,Bangham1965,Bangham1974} The potential for
delivery of anticancer therapeutics has been pursued since the early
1970's.\cite{Gregoriadis1974} They have particularly been successful in
increasing the bioavailability of anticancer therapeutics, such as doxorubicin
and curcumin, whilst having matured to take on forms allowing more advanced
passive and active targeting strategies.\cite{Al-Jamal2012,Huang1994,Li2007}

In addition, polymer-based micelles have also been developed, such as those
consisting of \iupac{poly-(lactic-co-glycolic) acid} (PLGA) for the
encapsulation of small molecules, including curcumin and
\iupac{all-\trans-retinoic acid}.\cite{Li2009,Yallapu2010b} This strategy has
been shown to produce drug encapsulation efficiencies of up to \SI{90}{\percent},
dramatically improving the solubility of, for example, a highly water insoluble
molecule such as curcumin. An example of typical formulation strategy is
exemplified in the work by Yallapu \latin{et al.}, shown in Figure
\ref{fig:PLA_curcumin_example}.\cite{Yallapu2010b}

the bioavailability of ATRA for its anticancer properties (i.e. the induction of
growth inhibition, differentiation or apoptosis in these cells).\cite{Fang2002}

\subsubsection{Protein-based drug delivery vehicles}

\subsection{Cartilage oligomeric matrix protein}

As detailed previously in Chapter \ref{chap:pff}, the cartilage oligomeric
matrix protein (COMP) is a non-collagenous matrix protein and member of the
thrombospondin (TSP) gene family of extracellular
glycoproteins.\cite{Adams2001,Smith1997,Muller1998,Hedbom1992,Oldberg1992}
Assignment of an ${\alpha}$-helical heptad motif to the oligomerization of COMP was
given to the N-terminal primary sequence defined by 46 residues (Gly27-Gly72),
which will be referred to as COMP coiled-coil, or COMPcc.\cite{Efimov1994} The
mapping of this heptad motif pattern is shown in Figure \ref{fig:our_COMP}. This
sequence was later cloned into a pQE9 expression vector by
Tirrell.\cite{Shen2006a} For additional information on the origins of the COMPcc
protein, please refer to Section \ref{sec:comp}.

\subsubsection{Repurposing of coiled-coil domains}

The field of chemical biology has experienced an increase in interest in the
potential of naturally-derived coiled-coil proteins and peptides to serve as
functionally engineered macromolecules. Much of the work, as is evidenced by the
efforts devoted to
COMPcc, is focused on probing these proteins
beyond the endogenous roles, and observing emergent properties, both functional
and structural.\cite{McFarlane2012,McFarlane2009,Ozbek2002,Gunasekar2009,Gunasekar2012,Guo1998} This is also exemplified in the work on the right-handed coiled
coil (RHCC) protein from \latin{Staphylothermus marinus}, originally discovered
in 1996 by Peters \latin{et al.} and later solved for its structure by Stetefeld
\latin{et al.}.\cite{Peters1996,Stetefeld2000}

% --------------------------
The RHCC forms a tetrameric right-handed coiled-coil that has been shown to
contain four large internal cavities, naturally occupied by water, but capable
of incorporating heavy metals. In 2009, Eriksson \latin{et al.} carried out the
first example of using this emergent ability of the RHCC to encapsulate a
heavy metal-based chemotherapeutic, \emph{cis}-diammine-dichloroplatinum (II)
(cisplatin), a potent antitumor drug that is particular effective in the
treatment of testicular carcinoma, ovarian, cervical, head and neck, 
non-small cell lung cancer, bladder and stomach cancers.\cite{Go1999} Their
results demonstrated that RHCC could bind to cisplatin, allow cellular uptake
(Figure \ref{fig:coiled-coil_binding}), as well as not inhibit
the native action of cisplatin of tumor growth inhibition. An interesting result
from this study pertains to a synergistic effect against two drug-resistant cell
lines: the myeloma 8226/dox40 and the small-cell lung cancer H69AR, suggestive
of the possibility that the complex of RHCC and cisplatin exhibits a different
mode of entry or action than cisplatin alone.

% --------------------------

Gunasekar and Montclare have shown that it is possible to tune, within a degree
of predictability, the binding affinities of COMPcc to small
molecules.\cite{Gunasekar2009} The formation of fibrillar nanoscopic assemblies
by COMPcc, as presented by Gunasekar,\cite{Gunasekar2012} demonstrates the
potential for that particular coiled-coil protein to behave as a nanocarrier
\latin{in vivo}. Similar to the RHCC, COMPcc benefits from a defined hydrophobic
pore, within which small molecules may be non-covalently complexed as temporary
payload (Figure \ref{fig:coiled-coil_binding}).  Furthermore, with
supramolecular assembly diameters between \SIrange{10}{15}{\nm} (see Figure
\ref{fig:COMP_EM_2}), COMPcc can potentially entrain and stem the premature
efflux of small molecules out of therapeutic delivery sites and cavities.
\latin{De novo} efforts are also underway to develop coiled-coils for medical
imaging applications, the development of a binuclear metal binding motif, as
well as the creation of a comprehensive basis set of peptides with which to aid
in the design of \latin{de novo}
coiled-coils.\cite{Shiga2012,Fletcher2012,Berwick2014} The incorporation efforts
by Berwick \latin{et al.} of Ln(III), a trivalent lanthanide ion, and Gd (III)
into the hydrophobic core of a trimeric \latin{de novo} coiled-coil peptide
demonstrates this potential for nuclear magnetic imaging applications of
coiled-coil proteins.\cite{Berwick2014} The authors surmise that by isolating
these imaging contrast ions to the hydrophobic pore of coiled-coils, the
influence of bulk water can be attenuated.

The ability to self-assemble into mesoscopic structures (Figure
\ref{fig:COMP_EM_2}) makes COMPcc particularly attractive as a drug delivery
vehicle. This tendency for self-assembly has been studied by Gunasekar, and has
interestingly been found to be coupled to multiple binding modalities of
COMPcc.\cite{Gunasekar2012} The complexation of certain divalent metal ions,
such as Zn(II), to the N-terminal His-tag domain of COMPcc have been shown to
effect, in certain variants (e.g. wild-type and T40A), helical formation and
fiber formation are enhanced. This has been further correlated to an increase in
binding affinity for curcumin, a small hydrophobic molecule previously shown to
bind to COMPcc.\cite{Haghpanah2010} This work demonstrates a significant
interplay between supramolecular assembly of COMPcc and its functional
properties as a drug delivery vehicle.

COMPcc was also incorporated as a domain of protein-based block co-polymers,
based on an elastin-like peptide paired
domain.\cite{Haghpanah2010,Yuvienco2012,Dai2011,Haghpanah2009} From these
studies, strong interdomain influences were apparent. Block orientation
architectures as well as elastin domain length were both found to greatly
influence the self-assembly and binding properties of the block co-polymers.
One particular variant, COMPcc-elastin, demonstrated enhanced binding to
curcumin beyond that of COMPcc alone, while the elastin-COMPcc variant was found
to depress binding affinities toward curcumin.\cite{Haghpanah2010}

It is in this vein of protein engineering - which has matured to the point
of discrete control of sequence, structure, and function - that the work herein
intends to operate. With the ability to form macroscopic fiber-like assemblies
whilst encapsulating small hydrophobic molecules in its pore region with
\si{\micro\moLar} to \si{\nano\moLar} affinities,
the COMPcc protein documented herein (Figure
\ref{fig:our_COMP}) may provide the necessary behavior to sustain therapeutics
in the synovial joint cavity for extended periods. Continuing microscopy studies
of COMPcc by Montclare demonstrate even larger fibers at higher
concentrations of COMPcc protein, with dimensional features on the scale of
micrometers (see Figure \ref{fig:COMP_EM_3}).

Application of COMPcc has been proposed and partially validated by Tirrell
\latin{et al.} during the course of developing hydrogel networks based on COMPcc
protein.\cite{Shen2006a}. They report that COMPcc-based gels
are indeed non-toxic (assessed by viability of mammalian 3T3 fibroblast cell
cultures). Herein an additional assessment of the cytotoxicity of the COMPcc
protein was evaluated with preosteoblast MC3T3 cells, prior to undertaking the
study. The coiled-coil domain of COMP demonstrated to be inert toward cell
viability (Figure \ref{fig:mtt_results}).

In collaboration with the group led by Dr. Thorsten Kirsch (NYU Joint Disease
Hospital), we intended to evaluate the ability for a protein construct to bind
to a therapeutic RAR agonist and/or antagonist to demonstrate the feasibility of
non-covalently storing such hydrophobic molecules for long-term delivery. This
work specifically addresses the delivery of the inverse agonist, BMS493 (Figure
\ref{fig:RAR_communication}). Taking a protein engineering approach to the
problem of bioavailability, we intend to evaluate the efficacy with which the
coiled-coil domain of rat cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMPcc) binds to
BMS493, and correlate these results to ongoing \latin{in vitro} studies of the
effects of protein complexation on the therapeutic efficacy of BMS493, led by
the Kirsch Group.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{General}

All reagents for biosynthesis were obtained from Alfa Aesar or Fisher
Scientific. BMS493 and \iupac{all-\trans-retinoic acid} were obtained from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Liquid chromatography solvent were obtained from EMD
Millipore, Sigma Aldrich, or Honeywell.

\subsection{Protein preparation methods}

\subsubsection{Biosynthesis}

In anticipation for the need of large quantities of protein mass for the
effective distribution in either \latin{in vitro} cultures and/or 
osteoarthritic murine models, partial effort was devoted to migrating the
biosynthesis of COMPcc to a high-yield, auto-induction expression workflow. This
was accomplished through efforts, namely, the adoption of \ch{RbCl2}
chemically competent expression hosts,\cite{Renzette2011} optimization of auto-induction media
composition,\cite{Studier2005} and the scaling of these methods to a bioreactor format. The
results of benchmark observations pertaining to these efforts are reported (see
Section \ref{sec:comp_biosynthesis_results}).

All reagents used for the biosynthesis of COMPcc protein were sterile filtered
through a \SI{0.22}{\um} filter prior to usage. Biosynthesis of pQE9-COMPcc was
carried out in a chemically competent BL21(DE3) \emph{E.coli} host cell line
grown at large scales with auto-induction media.  The COMPcc gene, previously
created by PCR assembly and inserted into the pQE9 vector (Figure
\ref{fig:plasmid_pQE9-COMP}), a gift from Zhang,\cite{Shen2006a} was transformed
into the cells following the improved \ch{RbCl2} method of chemical
transformation, specifically abiding by the protocol set forth by Nicholas
Renzette.\cite{Renzette2011} Cells were then plated onto tryptic soy agar plates
(\SI{40}{\mg\per\mL} supplemented with \SI{200}{\ug\per\mL} ampicillin.
\SI{10}{\mL} starter cultures were prepared from single colonies, prepared in
1xM9 media and supplemented with the reagents listed in Table
\ref{tab:COMP_expression_media}.

% --------------------------
Starter cultures were used to inoculate larger scale expression media in either
a baffled flask or a bioreactor format, comprising a \SI{4}{\volper} of the
large scale media. Cells were grown in M9 in a single auto-induction stage as
per the methods set forth by Studier.\cite{Studier2005} As per this method, the
media of the large scale expression was bereft of glucose, as documented in
Table \ref{tab:COMP_expression_media} and instead was supplemented with
\SI{0.5}{\wtper} glycerol, \SI{0.05}{\wtper} glucose, and \SI{0.2}{\wtper}
lactose, the ratios of which have been previously optimized to yield optimally
timed expression of protein controlled by an inducible promoter governed by the
\emph{lac} operon.\cite{Studier2005} Flask expressions were carried out in
\SI{1}{\L} baffled flasks for \SI{8}{\hour} at \SI{37}{\celsius}, shaking at
\SI{350}{\rpm}. In addition, larger scale expression methods were employed by
ways of a \SI{7.5}{\L} BioFlo 110 bioreactor/fermenter (New Brunswick
Scientific), operated in bioreactor mode for \emph{E.coli} growth and equipped
with a water jacketed temperature control system. The reactor was operated with
the parameters shown in Table \ref{tab:bioreactor_parameters}.

The cultures were subsequently harvested and pelleted via centrifugation at
\SI{4000}{\gforce} for \SI{20}{\minute} at \SI{4}{\celsius} on an Allegra 25R
Centrifuge (Beckman Coulter) using a swinging bucket rotor, and stored
immediately at \SI{-20}{\celsius} for downstream lysis. \SI{1}{\mL} aliquots of
the cultures were sampled at particular time points for SDS-PAGE analysis. Each
aliquot was centrifuged at \SI{12000}{\rpm} at room temperature for
\SI{2}{\minute} on a 5415D Microtube Centrifuge (Eppendorf) prior to decanting
of the supernatant and storage at \SI{-20}{\celsius}.

\subsubsection{Protein purification}
All solutions used in the extraction and purification of recombinant proteins
were filtered through \SI{0.22}{\um} sterile filters. In addition, all solutions
were adjusted to the appropriate pH with either \SI{37}{\percent} \ch{HCl} or
\SI{1}{\moLar} \ch{NaOH}. Lysis of harvested cells was carried out under
denaturing conditions, assisted with probe sonication. Cell pellets were thawed
at \SI{4}{\celsius} and immediately resuspended in lysis buffer consisting of
\SI{50}{\milli\moLar} \ch{Na2HPO4}, \SI{6}{\moLar} urea, and
\SI{20}{\milli\moLar} imidazole, \pH 8.0. The suspension was then subjected to
sonication with a Q700 probe sonication system (Qsonica), equipped with a
\SI{127}{\mm} probe and operated at \SI{50}{\percent} intensity with a
\SI{50}{\percent} duty cycle across a \SI{10}{\second} period duration,
ultimately transferring approximately \SI{200}{\joule\per\mL} of lysate slurry -
approximately requiring \SI{10}{\minute} for a \SI{100}{\mL} sample, averaging
\SI{33}{\watt}. The lysate was kept secured within an ice bath during sonication
so as to inhibit a significant increase in temperature. The sonicated product
was then clarified of debris by centrifugation at \SI{20000}{\gforce} for
\SI{2}{\hour} at \SI{4}{\celsius} on an Allegra 25R Centrifuge (Beckman Coulter)
using a fixed-angle rotor.

The clarified lysate was then applied to a \SI{5}{\mL} HiTrap IMAC FastFlow
column (GE Life Sciences), charged with \ch{CoCl2}, using an \"{A}KTA purifier
system (GE Life Sciences) at \SI{4}{\celsius}. The purifier was equipped with a
sample pump for external loading. The lysate was loaded with
\SI{20}{\milli\moLar} imidazole and washed with 10 column volumes (CV) of the
same buffer constitution. The protein was then eluted across 3 CVs of
\SI{510}{\milli\moLar} imidazole. Purified elutions were assayed for purity via
SDS-PAGE analysis, with an expected molecular weight of \SI{6.9}{\kilo\dalton}.
Polyacrylamide gels were cast using ammonium persulfate and
tetramethylethylenediamine-catalyzed polymerization to obtain \SI{12}{\wtper}
acrylamide gels. Gel lanes of pure protein were used to quantitate
post-purification yields, using an ImageQuant gel imaging system (GE Life
Sciences). Loaded mass of protein, from \SI{10}{\uL}, was calibrated against a
volumetric equivalent of Precision Plus Protein Unstained Standard mixture
(Bio-Rad). Contingent upon confirmation of \SI{90}{\percent} purity, was
desalted using Sephadex G-25 desalting resin, loaded into a pre-packed 5mL
HiTrap column format (GE Life Sciences) and equilibrated with
\SI{100}{\milli\moLar} Gomori buffer, prepared to pH 8.0. Desalting procedure
was accomplished using the \"{A}KTA purifier system. Purification elutions were
loaded into a \SI{10}{\mL} column format Superloop for queued \SI{1}{\mL}
injections onto the desalting column. The desalting column was equilibrated with
5 CVs of buffer prior to each injection.

\subsubsection{Endotoxin removal}

Protein elutions were separated from pyrogenic lipopolysaccharides using a
\SI{1}{\mL} gravity column loaded with Detoxi-Gel (Pierce) consisting of
Polymixin B, an antibiotic that contains a cationic cyclopeptide with a fatty
acid chain, immobilized onto a network of \SI{6}{\percent} cross-linked beaded
agarose. All solutions (except for sample) were prepared with pyrogen-free water
generated with an Integral 3 MilliQ water purification system (EMD Millipore),
equipped with a UV lamp submersed in the water storage tank to inhibit bacterial
growth and biofilm proliferation as well as a point-of-use \SI{0.22}{\um}
Bio-Pak filter, for the generation of pyrogen-free, DNAase-free, and RNase-free
water. All solutions were additionally filtered through sterile \SI{0.22}{\um}
non-pyrogenic syringe filters prior to immediate usage with the column and
degassed under high vacuum (\SI{15}{\um}) for \SI{20}{\minute}. The column was
regenerated prior and immediately after each challenge with protein sample by
equilibrating it with \SI{5}{\mL} of \SI{1}{\wtper} deoxycholate (in the form of
deoxycholic acid, sodium salt). This was then followed by washing with
\SI{5}{\mL} of pyrogen-free water. The column was then equilibrated with
\SI{5}{\mL} of \SI{10}{\milli\moLar} Gomori phosphate buffer,
\SI{500}{\milli\moLar} \ch{NaCl} prepared to pH 8.0. Just prior to the liquid
level surpassing the top frit, the sample was loaded onto the column. As the
sample completely infused the bed of resin, beyond the frit, the column was
sealed at both ends and the sample was allowed to incubate in the column for
\SI{1}{\hour}. The column was then loaded with additional buffer and was allowed
to elute the sample. Sample was eluted with \SI{300}{\milli\moLar} and
\SI{500}{\milli\moLar} NaCl. Samples were then assayed for endotoxin levels
using the limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assay, carried out with a Pierce LAL
Chromogenic Endotoxin Quantitation kit (Thermo Scientific).

\subsubsection{Protein concentration}
Purified protein product was assayed for concentration by way of a Thermo
Scientific Micro BCA Protein Assay Kit, which utilizes bicinchoninic acid as the
detection reagent for \ch{Cu^1+}, which is formed when \ch{Cu^2+} is reduced by
protein in an alkaline environment.\cite{Smith1985}

\subsection{In vitro methods}

\subsubsection{Cell culture methods}
\label{sec:culture_methods}

Chondrocytes were treated with formulations based on COMPcc and BMS493 to
evaluate its A panel of catabolic gene markers, including Cox-2, IL-6, iNOS, and MMP-13, will
be assessed for chondrocytes treated with COMPcc+BMS493. They have each been
shown to play a major role in OA pathology. Type X collagen will also be
measured to assay the extent of hypertrophic differentiation among the
cells.\cite{Lotz1992,Geng1995,Malemud2013,DiCesare2002,Pichika2004,Murrell1995}
%MMP-13 (collagenase-3) is known to be involved in degradation
%of type II collagen, proteoglycans and other matrix
%proteins,\cite{Flannery2006} 

Articular chondrocytes were isolated from 2-month-old wild-type mice.  Cells
were grown in monolayer cultures in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle (DME; Lonza)
medium containing \SI{5}{\percent} fetal calf serum, \SI{2}{\milli\moLar}
\iupac{\L-glutamine} and \SI{50}{U\per\mL} penicillin and streptomycin. After
the cells reached confluency, they were then cultured in the presence of ATRA in
a concentration of \SI{200}{\nano\moLar}, which is approximately the
concentration observed in the synovial fluid of osteoarthritic
patients,\cite{Davies2009} and also observed to be most effective in stimulating
the mRNA levels of catabolic and hypertrophic markers in human and mouse
articular chondrocytes.\cite{Campbell2013b} Cells were grown in the presence of
ATRA for 24 hours at which point the culture media was supplemented with
COMPcc -/+ BMS493.

The COMPcc + BMS493 was prepared by combining \SI{125}{\micro\moLar} COMPcc protein
with an ethanol solution of BMS493 prepared to \SI{500}{\micro\moLar} resulting
in a final concentration of \SI{100}{\micro\moLar} COMPcc, \SI{100}{\micro\moLar}
BMS493 and \SI{20}{\volper} ethanol. The formulation was incubated at
\SI{4}{\celsius} for 24 hours prior to supplementation. The mixture was added to
cell culture media as a 1:100 diluted supplement, yielding final concentrations
of \SI{1}{\micro\moLar} COMPcc and BMS493.

\subsubsection{Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and
real-time PCR analysis} RNA was isolated from cell cultures using an RNeasy Mini
kit (Qiagen). Levels of messenger RNA (mRNA) for COX-2, IL-6, iNOS, MMP-13, and
type X collagen were quantified by real-time PCR. \SI{1}{\micro\gram} RNA was
reverse transcribed using Omniscript RT kit (Qiagen). The resultant cDNA was
used as the template to quantitate the relative content of mRNA using a 1:100
dilution, analyzed with a ABI Prism 7300 sequence detection system) using
respective primers and SYBR Green.  PCR reactions were performed with a SYBR
Green PCR Master Mix kit (Applied Biosystems) and the primers listed in Table
\ref{tab:pcr_primers} at \SI{95}{\celsius} for 10 minutes, followed by 40 cycles
of \SI{95}{\celsius} for 15 seconds and \SI{60}{\celsius} for 1 minute. 18S RNA
was amplified at the same time and used as an internal control. Transcript
levels were calculated according to the equation ${x=s^{- \Delta C q}}$, where
${\Delta C q = C q_{exp} - C q _{18S}}$.

\subsection{Analytical methods}

\subsubsection{Small molecule extraction}
Quantification of BMS493 from cultures required the optimization of an
extraction methodology, two of which were investigated.\footnote{Solid phase
    extraction methods, using commercially available Sep-Pak \ch{C18} and Oasis
    gel columns (both Waters Corporation), were also evaluated, but the data is
not presented in this particular draft of this document.} It was deemed critical
to attain high extraction efficiencies of BMS493, as well as ATRA, from aqueous
media so as to properly quantify \si{\nano\mol} amounts of analyte,
indiscernible via conventional spectroscopic instrumentation. This would aid in
not only evaluating the optimal dosage of BMS493, but also offer insight as to
whether the BMS493 is taken up by cells, released, degraded, or residing in the
culture medium. Furthermore, available proven conditions for HPLC analysis of, at
the very least, ATRA and its isomers exist in the literature with which a basis
was built upon for BMS493
separation.\cite{Kim2010b,Chauveau-Duriot2010,Schaffer2010,Kane2008b,DeLeenheer1982,Motto1989} 

Two variations of liquid-liquid extraction were employed to assist in the
quantitation of BMS493 in culture samples. The first method consisted of
extracting hydrophobic molecules, including BMS493, using ethyl acetate as an
organic phase to be layered atop a 1:1 volumetric equivalent of
\SI{100}{\milli\moLar} Gomori phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, \SI{1}{\percent} DMSO,
\SI{10}{\micro\moLar} analyte. For preliminary feasibility studies, ATRA was
used as an analyte due to its relatively higher absorption coefficient and
increased water solubility. \SI{500}{\uL} of ethylacetate was mixed with
\SI{500}{\uL} of sample and vortexed vigorously for 2 minutes. The sample was
then centrifuged at \SI{1725}{\rpm} at room temperature for \SI{5}{\minute} on a
CentriVap Centrifugal Vacuum Evaporator (Labconco). \SI{400}{\uL} of the organic
phase was then sampled and dried using a vacuum centrifuge (Labconco). The dried
extract was subsequently dissolved in ethanol analyzed for an absorption
spectrum.

The second method of liquid-liquid extraction employed iterated on the technique
listed in the first method. Extraction was carried out across 5 replicates of
controls, consisting of either MilliQ water or DME medium. Each replicate was
spiked with \SI{1}{\milli\moLar} BMS493, prepared in DMSO, to yield final
concentrations of \SI{1}{\micro\moLar} BMS493, \SI{1}{\percent} DMSO.
\SI{50}{\uL} was transferred from these samples to a borosilicate glass test
tube and mixed with \SI{1}{\mL} of spectroscopic grade ethyl acetate (20:1
volumetric ratio). The organic/aqueous sample was then agitated for
\SI{30}{\minute} in an Ultrasonic Cleaner bath (VWR) operating at
\SI{35}{\kilo\hertz}, which had been pre-chilled to
approximately \SI{10}{\celsius}. The samples were then centrifuged for
\SI{5}{\minute} to separate the phases again. \SI{900}{\uL} of the organic phase
was then transferred to a separate glass test tube for vacuum
centrifuge-assisted drying.  The vacuum centrifuge was operated at
\SI{60}{\celsius} for \SI{60}{\minute}, equipped with a dry ice trap to
accommodate the  ethyl acetate condensation. The dried products were then
incubated at \SI{-80}{\celsius} and subsequently freeze-dried using a Freeze
Zone 6 flask lyophilizer unit (Labconco), which was allowed to take place
overnight. This final step was necessary to sublime the trace amounts of DMSO
that had transferred to the ethyl acetate phase. The dried product was then
dissolved in \SI{100}{\uL} of ethanol or acetonitrile and injected onto a
\ch{C18} reverse-phase column for quantitation against a set of standards.

BMS493 standards were prepared from dry BMS493 (Sigma Aldrich) that was
resuspended in DMSO to yield a concentration of \SI{4}{\mg\per\mL}.
\SI{50.55}{\uL} of the solution was then freeze-dried and dissolved in
\SI{1}{\mL} of ethanol or acetonitrile to yield a \SI{500}{\micro\moLar} stock
solution. This was then used to make diluted amounts of 5, 2.5, 1, 0.75, 0.5,
0.25, and \SI{0.1}{\micro\moLar} solutions. Each standard was spiked with retinyl
palmitate as an internal standard, set constant at \SI{10}{\micro\moLar}.
Samples and standards were then analyzed using an Acquity H-Class UPLC system,
as per the aforementioned methods.

%A dosage study of BMS493 was carried out across the following concentrations:
%0, 0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 10, and \SI{20}{\micro\moLar}.  \SI{50}{\uL} aliquots were
%retrieved from the initial \SI{2}{\mL} cultures at specific time points: 0, 1,
%6, 24, and \SI{30}{\hour}. Each of the aliquots was then subjected to an
%extraction technique for subsequent quantitation via UPLC for BMS493 content.
%Cultures were thereafter supplemented with \SI{1}{\micro\moLar} BMS493 as a
%treatment method.

\subsubsection{Reverse-phase chromatographic quantitation}

Reverse-phase chromatography was carried out on a Acquity H-Class ultra-high
pressure/performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) system (Waters Corporation),
equipped with a tunable UV detector, thermostatted sample compartment, and
column heater. For all retinoid and retinoid agonists, the sample compartment
was kept at \SI{4}{\celsius}. An Acquity UPLC Ethylene Bridged Hybrid (BEH) \ch{C18} column,
\SI{130}{\angstrom}, \SI{1.7}{\um}, \SI{2.1}{\mm} ${\times}$ \SI{100}{\mm}
column (Waters Corporation) was used for separations, equipped with a VanGuard
\ch{C18} pre-column (Waters Corporation). The system was configured with a
tertiary solvent system consisting of MilliQ water, acetonitrile, and methanol,
all at \SI{0.1}{\percent} formic acid. Specific gradients varied amongst methods
on the path toward optimization of protocols, and are listed in the
chromatograms. The pump wash solvent consisted of \SI{10}{\percent}
acetonitrile. The sample manager's needle wash solvent and syringe purge solvent
consisted of acetonitrile (\SI{0.1}{\percent} formic) and \SI{70}{\percent}
acetonitrile, respectively. The column was kept at \SI{40}{\celsius}. All runs
were performed at \SI{1.17}{\mL\per\minute} unless otherwise stated. The TUV
detector was configured to collect at \SI{324}{\nm}, \SI{329}{\nm}, and
\SI{354}{\nm}, in addition to a low-sensitivity 2D spectral scan.

\subsection{Biophysical methods}

\subsubsection{Circular dichroism spectroscopy}

Circular dichroism (CD) was carried out consistent with previously reported
methods.\cite{Haghpanah2009,Gunasekar2009,Haghpanah2010,Yuvienco2012} Briefly,
CD spectroscopy was carried out on a J-815 CD polarimeter
(Jasco) equipped with a PTC-423S single position Peltier temperature control
system and cuvette holder, counter-cooled with an Isotemp 3016S water bath
(Fisher Scientific) set to \SI{22}{\celsius}. Sample solutions were inserted
into a Helma 218 quartz cuvette (\SI{300}{\uL} capacity, \SI{1}{\mm} path
length). Wavelength scans were performed with a \SI{1}{\nm} step size, collected
across 3 consecutive scans.

\subsubsection{Binding assay}

The evaluation of binding affinities could be approached from numerous
biophysical aspects, including intrinsic fluorescence assays,\cite{Kunwar2006}
coupled fluorescence of the small molecule upon binding,\cite{Barik2003}, and
hydrogen/deuterium exchange experiments.\cite{Erba2011} However, the first two
techniques do not lend themselves to the presented system, which does not
entertain a fluorescently-active chromophore, or an environmentally shift-worthy
tryptophan residue; the later option does not lend itself to conclusive nor
high-throughput adaption. As such, two methods were investigated for the
evaluation of binding affinities: zonal elution chromatography and Hummel-Dreyer
chromatography.

\subsubsection{Zonal elution chromatography}

Zonal elution chromatography involves the elution of a
macromolecule/small-molecule complex from free small-molecule via size exclusion
chromatographic separations, like those attained with with G-25 Sephadex resin
media, which segregates based on a narrow molecular weight cutoff ( ${<}$
\SI{1000}{\dalton}).\cite{Hummel1962} This method is particularly suited to irreversible binding
conditions, such as the loading of liposomes and subsequent separation from
remaining free small molecule payload.\cite{Pan2012,Wang2013} If, however, the
mechanism of loading of BMS493 into COMPcc occurs as to achieve equilibrium,
zonal elution will prove invalid. Because of the existence of axial dispersion
and resolution into separate zones, both characteristics of a gel filtration
column such as G-25 Sephadex, this method does not hold up to reversible complex
formation; the dilution gives rise to an ever decreasing proportion of complex,
the concentration of which tends to zero as the resolution of the two
reactants is effected.\cite{Winzor2001} Yet, since it is not known by which mode
the BMS493 will bind to the protein-based biomaterial, both methods will be
attempted.

Zonal elution chromatography was accomplished using Sephadex G-25 size-exclusion
resin pre-packed into a \SI{5}{\mL} HiTrap column format (GE Life Sciences). The
column was attached to a \"{A}KTA purifier system (GE Life Sciences) held at
\SI{4}{\celsius}. Protein and/or small molecule samples were prepared in
\SI{100}{\milli\moLar} Gomori phosphate buffer, prepared to pH 8.0 and
\SI{10}{\percent} organic co-solvent to facilitate solvation of the hydrophobic
retinoid analogue BMS493. The system was configured with one buffer line inserted into
the sample sample buffer composition, filtered, and immediately degassed via
sonication whilst under vacuum immediately prior to usage. Up to \SI{10}{\mL} of
sample was loaded into a \SI{10}{\mL} column format Superloop so as to limit the
dilution effects of the injection process. Periodic injections of \SI{1}{\mL} of
sample flowed onto the column at \SI{1}{\mL\per\minute}, and were immediately
followed by a continuous stream of buffer at the same flow rate for 3 column
volumes, yielding a time-course investigation of the protein
complex separation process.

\subsubsection{Hummel-Dreyer chromatography}
Hummel Dreyer chromatography is a variant of zonal elution chromatography, but
is able to withstand the rapid equilibrating interaction occurring at the fluid
flow front. This method involves the application of a small zone of acceptor
protein to a column of tightly cross-linked gel pre-equilibrated with a known
concentration of ligand.\cite{Hummel1962} The resultant elution profile exhibits
a peak of ligand concentration coincident with elution of acceptor as the
results of complex formation during acceptor zone migration through a
concentration of free ligand.  This method has been adapted successfully to both
FPLC and HPLC formats.\cite{Bieri1998}\footnote{The results for Hummel Dreyer
    analysis are still being collected and are thus not present in this draft of
the document.}

Hummel-Dreyer chromatography was carried out on an Aquity H-Class UPLC system
(Waters Corporation) equipped with a BEH125 SEC column, \SI{1.7}{\um},
\SI{4.6}{\mm} ${\times}$ \SI{300}{\mm}. The pump seal wash consisted of
\SI{10}{\percent} methanol. The isocratic mobile phase was composed via a
binary solvent system consisting of \SI{100}{\milli\moLar} Gomori sodium
phosphate buffer, prepared to pH 8.0, \SI{10}{\volper} methanol, containing
either \SI{0}{\micro\moLar} or \SI{50}{\micro\moLar} BMS493, prepared from a
\SI{500}{\micro\moLar} stock of BMS493 prepared in methanol, which is added to
buffer as \SI{10}{\volper}. Isocratic mobile phases of varying concentrations of
BMS493 were composed via binary combinations of the two solvent lines. All runs
were performed at \SI{0.25}{\mL\per\minute} unless otherwise stated.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Scaling biosynthetic methods}

\label{sec:comp_biosynthesis_results}
Expression of COMPcc was carried out in auto-inducing media, encompassing a
shift in protocols to lactose-rich media, in agreement with the methods refined
by Studier.\cite{Studier2005} Lactose has been shown by Studier to produce
significant expression level in amounts as small as \SI{0.005}{\percent}.
However, this effect is suppressed in the presence of amino acids and glucose,
shown empirically.\cite{Studier2005} Therefore, the auto-induction media can
replace media supplemented with \iupac{isopropyl \b-\D-1-thiogalactopyranoside}
(IPTG), by appropriating sufficient amino acids, glucose, and glycerol to
achieve nominal cell density prior to the preferential uptake of lactose and
induced expression in the absence of glucose and glycerol as carbon sources.
While this work has benefited from the robust automatic induction based on the
formulation of carbon sources, the original intention of the work by Studier was
to inhibit ``leaky'' expression, permitted by the hyperactive T7 polymerase,
typical in inducible expression systems.

Auto-induction growth can be sustained in baffled shaker flasks, according to
Figure \ref{fig:AI_OD_curve}, for up to \SI{12}{\hour} before growth plateaus,
either limited by pH shifts in the media or depletion of nutrients. Bioreactor
performance, however, suggests that static pH conditions may promote longer
sustaining growth for up to \SI{24}{\hour} (Figure
\ref{fig:bioreactor_OD_comparison}). Noteworthy is the maximal growth level
obtained via bioreactor expression, as also shown in Figure
\ref{fig:bioreactor_OD_comparison}. Comparison of auto-induction with
traditional shaker flask conditions suggest that the expression levels are
comparable on a cellular basis (Figure \ref{fig:AI_IPTG_gel}).  Yields have been
estimated to be in the range of \SIrange{10}{20}{\mg\per\mL} of culture, prior
to purification.

\subsection{Effects of COMPcc on BMS493 therapy}
\label{sec:bms493_results}

    \caption{mRNA levels of catabolic gene markers (COX-2, IL-6, iNOS, and

    cultures.}
    \label{fig:pcr_panel} \end{figure}
% --------------------------
To determine any potential therapeutic benefit provided by COMPcc protein in the
course of BMS493 supplementation, mRNA levels for catabolic and hypertrophic
markers were measured (see Figure \ref{fig:pcr_panel}) for articular
chondrocytes harvested and cultured from wild-type mice. Sample groups included
cells treated and untreated with retinoic acid, with the assumption that the
group treated with retinoic acid will exhibit up-regulation of all measured
markers, consistent with the \latin{in vitro} osteoarthritic
model.\cite{Davies2009,Cohen2006a} The BMS493 control group demonstrated either
the same or less expression levels of catabolic and hypertrophic markers,
consistent with previously unpublished results (shown in Figure
\ref{fig:kirsch_prelim_results}).
Levels of mRNA for catabolic markers, including COX-2, IL-6, iNOS, and MMP-13
all showed significant increases upon administration of COMPcc, and COMPcc+BMS493.
In the presence of BMS493, COMPcc showed a slight reduction in catabolic gene
expression. These initial results show that COMPcc mediates catabolism in
chondrocyte cultures, the effects of which are damped by interference with
RAR/RXR signaling.

% What causes the catabolic events? Two primary suspects: 1) COMPcc protein
% acting as a COMPcc fragment. 2) Endotoxins contaminating the preparations.
\label{sec:comp_catabolism}
Two possible causes for this up-regulation in catabolism are hypothesized and
interrogated as part of this study. The propensity of catabolic events may be
due the COMPcc protein itself. While the recombinant COMPcc protein that
does not demonstrate cytotoxic effects on cells (see Figure
\ref{fig:mtt_results}), it exists still as a construct based on a domain
fragment of the larger cartilage oligomeric matrix protein - a macromolecule
that shows distinct alterations in early stages of osteoarthritis. During early
OA, the presence of cytokines and IL-1${\beta}$ results in the fragmentation of
the larger COMP macromolecule.\cite{Heinegard2011} Reports in the mid-1990's
suggested that a hallmark of osteoarthritis was the sustained release and
fragmentation of ECM molecules, particularly COMP, into the synovial joint
cavity of traumatic injury and primary osteoarthritic patient
cases.\cite{Lohmander1994,DiCesare2002,Pichika2004} This work has continued
since to promote the notion of using COMP as a early-stage determinant of
primary and rheumatoid arthritis.\cite{Vilim1997,Vilim2002,Heinegard2011}
Furthering the pro-inflammatory potential of COMP, Carlsen showed that COMP
induced arthritis in rats in 1998, driven by the immune response toward both
native and denatured rat COMP.\cite{Carlsen1998}

However, the complete function of COMP and its fragments has yet to be fully
understood, including the coiled-coil domain. The other potential contributor to
the catabolic events shown in Figure \ref{fig:pcr_panel} may be pro-inflammatory
endotoxins that possibly taint the biosynthetic product. Lipopolysaccharides
have been reported to up-regulate catabolic markers including iNOS, various
MMPs, IL-6, IL-8, and COX-2 in chondrocytes, demonstrating an intense
catabolic response of chondrocytes to
endotoxins.\cite{Lotz1992,Geng1995,Malemud2013,Guerne1990,Murrell1995} These two
possible explanations for the results defining this study are explored further
in Sections \ref{sec:endotoxins} and \ref{sec:mmp13}.

%Provide a bit on lessons learned in the Discussion section about the future of
%these drug delivery products, citing Sengupta2010 and Petsch2000.

Interestingly, COMPcc and COMPcc+BMS493 both exhibit reductions
in hypertrophic gene expression of type X collagen, as shown in Figure
\ref{fig:pcr_panel}E, in the presence of retinoic acid. Reduction of type X
collagen extended beyond basal levels of untreated cells, alluding to a
potential for COMPcc to behave as an inhibitor of hypertrophic differentiation.

\subsection{Endotoxin levels in COMPcc protein}
\label{sec:endotoxins}

Endotoxin levels of the protein were measured using a limulus amebocyte lysate
(LAL) assay. The corresponding standard curve and cross-plotted sample data are
presented in Section \ref{sec:lal_assay}. These results indicate that protein
preparations following desalting, which do not undergo endotoxin removal,
contain approximately \SI{136}{\EU\per\mL} endotoxins.\footnote{Endotoxin levels
are measured and reported in units of endotoxin units, one of which is roughly
equivalent to \SI{100}{\pico\gram} of lipopolysaccharide from \latin{E.coli}.}
Protein elutions from the Detoxi-gel column, triggered by the flow of buffer
containing \SI{300}{\milli\moLar} and \SI{500}{\milli\moLar} \ch{NaCl} were
calculated to contain approximately \SI{27}{\EU\per\mL} and \SI{10}{\EU\per\mL}.
The addition of \ch{NaCl} was necessary to elute COMPcc protein from the column,
prompted by the discovery that, from protein concentration measurements of the
flowthrough and subsequent elution fractions in the presence of \ch{NaCl}, the
COMPcc protein non-specifically interacted with the column chemistry (consisting
of immobilized polymixin B) and does not appreciably flow through the column in
the absence of \ch{NaCl}. Despite significant reductions in endotoxin levels of
\SI{80}{\percent} and \SI{93}{\percent} for the \SI{300}{\milli\moLar} and
\SI{500}{\milli\moLar} \ch{NaCl} elutions, the presence of endotoxins in the
prepared samples provided the possibility of endotoxins contributing to the
catabolic events reported in Section \ref{sec:bms493_results}.

\subsection{Up-regulation of MMP-13 in the presence of COMPcc}
\label{sec:mmp13}
% --------------------------
\begin{figure}[h!] \centering \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{f_2_19}
    \caption{Relative mRNA levels of catabolic gene marker MMP-13 of wild-type mice
    chondrocytes when administered with various amounts of COMPcc protein,
    prepared in \SI{100}{\milli\moLar} Gomori phosphate buffer, pH 8.0. Groups
    represent concentrations of COMPcc with which the cell cultures were treated.
    Studies were conducted with desalted COMPcc and desalted COMPcc protein that had
    undergone the additional step of endotoxin removal. Non-endotoxin-free and
    endotoxin-free COMPcc contained approximately \SI{136}{\EU\per\mL} and
    \SI{27}{\EU\per\mL} of endotoxin, respectively.}\label{fig:mmp13}
\end{figure}
% --------------------------
To determine the possibility of endotoxin contamination effecting chondrocyte
catabolic gene expression, COMPcc was applied to chondrocytes in various
concentrations (\SIrange{0.01}{1.0}{\micro\moLar}) and measurements were collected
on resultant MMP-13 expression levels. Measurements were carried out on COMPcc
protein that had not undergone endotoxin removal as well as protein that had
been processed with column-assisted removal of endotoxins. These results are
shown in Figure \ref{fig:mmp13}, indicating a dose-dependent response of the
catabolic marker MMP-13 on COMPcc levels. However, the protein was shown to have a
lesser affect on up-regulating MMP-13 in the reduced presence of endotoxins.

These results indicate a disparate effect between the preparation methods of
COMPcc protein on chondrocyte catabolism based on the reduced up-regulation of
MMP-13, which further suggests that the high catabolic gene expression reported
in Section \ref{sec:bms493_results} is due primarily to the presence of
endotoxins present in the preparations. Despite the validity of that postulate,
however, the endotoxin-free COMPcc protein was found to be inert to MMP-13
levels when administered to a final concentration of \SI{10}{\nano\moLar}.

Basal uptake of BMS493 was assessed to understand whether
intracellular uptake of BMS493 existed as a possible bottleneck for its
therapeutic effects, or if the cells readily took up the BMS493. This would
allow for a better understanding of whether the synergistic effects of COMPcc on
BMS493 down-regulation of hypertrophic gene expression is correlated to an
increase in BMS493 uptake in the presence of COMPcc.

% --------------------------
To assess the basal uptake of BMS493 \latin{in vitro}, liquid-liquid
extraction was applied to aqueous samples of BMS493. Test control extracts were
prepared at \SI{1}{\micro\moLar} in \SI{50}{\uL} of sample, consistent with the
operating parameters of the \latin{in vitro} cell culture experiments. Dried
organic phase extract was dissolved in ethanol and injected onto a reverse-phase
column as per the method set forth in Section \ref{sec:rp_method}. Levels were
averaged across 5 replicates and compared against a benchmark of
\SI{100}{\percent} extraction efficiency, or a \SI{0.36405}{\ng} injection
(Figure \ref{fig:extract_controls}).

Extraction efficiency was approximately \SI{92}{\percent}.\footnote{A
    preliminary round of solid-phase extraction for two commercially available
    products - Sep-Pak \ch{C18} and Oasis columns (Waters Corporation) - (data
    not shown) was also carried out, resulting in \SI{18}{\percent} recovery
efficiencies.}
This extraction protocol was applied to a preliminary set of culture samples
from a BMS493 dosage study. This sample set varied in time, ATRA, and IL-1, with
a constant BMS493 concentration of \SI{20}{\micro\moLar} (Table
\ref{tab:culture_extracts_table}). It is evident from the corresponding
chromatogram in Figure \ref{fig:culture_extracts_chrom} that the extraction was
bereft of any unknown impurities aside from the analytes of interest. 

The peak about \SI{2.4}{\minute}, corresponding to BMS493, was isolated and
quantitated based on their peak areas against an external calibration of BMS493,
both sets of spectra internally calibrated against \SI{11}{\micro\moLar} retinyl
palmitate (Figure \ref{fig:culture_extracts_chrom_zoom}). The amount (\si{\ng})
of sample in the injection are plotted in Figure
\ref{fig:culture_extracts_chart} and labeled with the calculated \% uptake by
cells. Within \SI{1}{\hour} of incubation, the data suggests a marked decrease
in free BMS493 (\SI{60}{\percent} reduction), either due to cellular uptake or
to degradative processes.  Furthermore, there appears to be synergistic uptake
of BMS493 over time in the presence of \SI{200}{\nano\moLar} ATRA, when
comparing samples \textbf{4} and \textbf{5}, which show a \SI{86}{\percent} and
\SI{95}{\percent} reduction in free BMS493, respectively. This synergistic
uptake is also observed, but to a much lesser extent, at the \SI{1}{\hour} time
point, referring to samples \textbf{2} and \textbf{3}, which differ by a minute
\SI{3}{\percent}. These results demonstrate that BMS493 is not completely taken
up by cells, presenting a possible route for which COMPcc improves the
therapeutic effects of BMS493.

\subsection{Binding mechanism of COMPcc to BMS493}
\label{sec:binding_mechanism}
Interactions between COMPcc and BMS493 were interrogated via a panel of
biophysical techniques, including CD spectroscopy, zonal elution chromatography
and high-performance size-exclusion chromatography.

\subsubsection{Secondary structure of COMPcc is not altered by BMS493}
\label{sec:comp_cd}
% --------------------------
\begin{figure}[h!] \centering \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{f_2_22}

    intensity is expressed in molar residue ellipticity (MRE)
units.}\label{fig:comp_cd} \end{figure}
% --------------------------
The effects of BMS493 on the secondary structure of COMPcc was probed via CD
spectroscopy. This COMPcc protein has been previously characterized for its
secondary structure at various temperatures by Gunasekar.\cite{Gunasekar2009}
Here CD spectroscopic measurements of the COMPcc were performed in the absence and
presence of BMS493. COMPcc and COMPcc+BMS493 samples for CD spectroscopy were
prepared according to the protocol listed in Section \ref{sec:culture_methods}.
The data indicate that the ${\alpha}$-helical structure of COMPcc, suggested by its
characteristic double minima CD signature, is not significantly altered by
BMS493 either immediately or over the course of \SI{24}{\hour}. While
co-solvated BMS493 does not destabilize the ${\alpha}$-helical structure, it does not
enhance it either, which has been reported for some mutational variants of this
COMPcc in the presence of the small molecule vitamin
D\textsubscript{3}.\cite{Gunasekar2009}

\end{figure}
% --------------------------
The method of zonal elution chromatography was applied to BMS493. Briefly,
COMPcc and BMS493 were mixed and incubated in the sample loop chamber of an
\"{A}KTA purifier system, awaiting successive periodic injections as shown in
Figure \ref{fig:zonal_elution_report}. 

The chromatograms suggest that the protein is eluting within the first
\SI{50}{\percent} of the column's total bed volume, i.e. \SI{2.5}{\mL},
consistent with the typical migration profile of macromolecules through G-25
media.  Interestingly, there is a shift in the elution peaks to earlier
retention volumes, which approach the void volume (\SI{1.5}{\mL}) of the column
as injection times progress. This shift in both intensity and retention time of
the elution curve, as charted in Figure \ref{fig:ze_intensity} and
\ref{fig:ze_retention_times}. The shift in retention times plotted in Figure
\ref{fig:ze_retention_times} may indicate the oligomerization of COMPcc over time
while the sample resides in the injection loop.

\label{sec:ze_premature_assembly}
The increase in intensity, contrary to presupposition, may not be due to a
superposition of BMS493 signal, which in itself is comparatively weak in the
control injections (data not shown), but may rather be due to macroscopic
assembly, resulting in light scattering within the flow cell detector. This
would, however, further confirm the conclusion that the protein is
self-assembling into larger structures over time. Alternatively, the low signal
at \SI{0}{\hour} may indicate that the protein, in its fiber assembly form,
suffers adherence effects to the LC system and column media, and that larger
structures exist in the sample prior to analysis. The increase in intensity over
time may be the result of residual protein sloughing off the LC components over
time, approaching an equilibrium of adherence effects between the components and
COMPcc.

    curves are shown in (b) and (c) for COMPcc and COMPcc+BMS493, respectively.
    }\label{fig:sec_results}
\end{figure}
% --------------------------
Hummel-Dreyer experiments were conducted to determine if BMS493 was binding
to COMPcc and, if so, whether affinities for the small molecule could be assigned
to particular oligomeric states of COMPcc. In this class of
experiments, macromolecules with an affinity for ligand tend to sequester ligand
from the mobile phase as the macromolecule migrates through the column bed. This
results in a differential accumulation (peak) and corresponding dearth (trough)
in small molecule signal along the chromatographic separation curve. 

BMS493 was intended to be measured in this fashion by monitoring absorption at
\SI{329}{\nm}, and concurrent data pertaining to protein elution by monitoring
\SI{254}{\nm}.  Control injections of BMS493, however, did not produce
significant signal either at \SI{329}{\nm} or within \SIrange{210}{400}{\nm}
sufficient to illicit quantitative results. This is in contrast to the
significant signal achieved via reverse-phase separation (see Section
\ref{sec:rp_method}); the difference may be due to either a suffered loss in
absorption coefficient when BMS493 is co-solvated in buffer with
\SI{10}{\volper} or a lack of solvation of BMS493 when co-solvated under those
conditions and concentrations (i.e.  \SI{50}{\micro\moLar}).

In the presence of a mobile phase containing co-solvated BMS493, COMPcc does
demonstrate a decrease in retention time within the column as compared to its
migration through the same mobile phase in the absence of BMS493. This suggests
the dominance of distinctly different oligomeric species for the two conditions.
A shift is observed for the COMPcc+BMS493 complex from a tetrameric species to a
molecular weight above its expected pentameric state. 

While the peak retention time is slightly higher than that expected for the
pentameric state (\SI{3200}{\Da}), it is still within \SI{10}{\percent} of the
total molecular weight, and thus is within an expected degree of error.
Regardless, the shift in retention times is significant given the
sample-to-sample error as well as the correlation coefficients of the
calibration curves.
%The peak retention time for COMPcc+BMS493 corresponds to approximately
%\SI{3200}{\Da} above the expected pentameric molecular weight of the protein
%(i.e. ${7297.2 \times 5}$, or \SI{36486}{\Da}). 
%If this loss in retention time is indeed attributed to
%sequestered BMS493 molecules, then the additional weight can be assigned to
%approximately 8 molecules of BMS493 for every pentameric complex.
This loss in retention time may be attributed to the induction of
pentamerization by BMS493. Synergistic effects between protein structure and
binding for COMPcc have been demonstrated for certain divalent metal ions and
their effect on COMPcc assembly and resultant binding
properties.\cite{Gunasekar2012}

While this particular instance of the Hummel-Dreyer method did not yield the
anticipated results derived from small molecule signal analysis performed at
\SI{329}{\nm}, its application on a high-resolution size-exclusion column may
have still provided valuable insight into the propensity of COMPcc to complex to
BMS493. This high-resolution separation allowed the observation of BMS493
forming pentameric complexes in the presence of BMS493. Furthermore, no other
oligomeric species were observed for both conditions of the experiments.

\section{Discussion}
% --------------------------
\subsection{Contamination of recombinant COMPcc with endotoxins}
The importance of endotoxin removal from recombinant protein preparations has
been emphasized in the related literature,\cite{Petsch2000,Sengupta2010} and
has remained an elusive goal for many recombinant proteins with conventional
column chemistries and separation strategies.\cite{Chen2009,Liu1997,Ritzen2007}
Contamination of the protein samples produced for this study resulted in the
unanticipated effects on the chondrocyte transcriptome. Specifically, elevated
levels in pyrogenic lipopolysaccharides present in the proteins following
column-assisted desalting correlated with the elevated levels in MMP-13
expression observed for the protein. While, according to the data in Section
\ref{sec:mmp13}, it is still feasible to deliver nanomolar quantities
(\SIrange{10}{50}{\nano\moLar}) of ``endo-toxin-free'' protein to chondrocytes
without eliciting a catabolic response, the efficiencies of endotoxin removal
can be improved, with current efficiencies ranging \SIrange{80}{95}{\percent}.
Furthermore, polymixin B-based column chemistry for the separation of endotoxins
from COMPcc may not be ideal given that NaCl is required to elute COMPcc from this
particular media, allowing for co-elution of endotoxins with COMPcc if NaCl also
disrupts the affinity for the charged head groups of lipopolysaccharides.

Further supporting attribution of causality of the results in Section
\ref{sec:bms493_results} to the presence of endotoxins by way of discrediting
the alternative hypothesis that COMPcc itself is potentially a trigger for the
modified gene levels, a recent study by Ruthard \latin{et al.} concluded that
the larger COMP protein lacks the ability to cause pro-inflammatory response in
chondrocytes.\cite{Ruthard2014} This finding stands in the face of at least two
decades of reports contributing to the hypothesis that COMP and its fragments
are causally involved in the inflammatory response of
chondrocytes,\cite{Lohmander1994,Vilim1997,Heinegard2011,Adams2001,Vilim2002}
with the most opposed precedent presented by Carlsen.\cite{Carlsen1998}
This simply leaves the result of down-regulation of the hypertrophic phenotype,
as demonstrated in Figure \ref{fig:pcr_panel}E, indicating relatively lower
levels of ${\alpha}$1 type X collagen for COMPcc-containing formulations.
Therefore, contingent upon further optimization of endotoxin removal strategies,
COMPcc may provide additional benefit to the delivery of RAR/RXR
antagonists and inverse agonists as demonstrated by early evidence of
down-regulating hypertrophic gene expression and terminal differentiation.

\subsection{COMPcc inhibits hypertrophy in osteoarthritic chondrocytes}
\label{sec:discuss_hypertrophy}
% --------------------------
Interestingly, COMPcc is observed to have a standalone inhibitory effect on type X
collagen expression, a decrease of almost 2-fold from the negative control
containing ATRA (see Figure \ref{fig:pcr_panel}E). This anti-hypertrophic response
of chondrocyte due to COMPcc has not been observed before in the prior literature,
nor has it been observed for other fragments stemming from the cartilage
oligomeric matrix protein. The underlying cause of this reductive effect on
chondrocyte hypertrophy may relate to the hitherto reported ability of COMPcc to
bind \iupac{all-\trans-retinol};\cite{Guo1998} this ability may have been
extended to accommodate ATRA, in effect causing the COMPcc to behave as a scavenger
of ATRA. This model presupposes a binding affinity for ATRA that is stronger than
that for the BMS493 presumably bound to the oligomer, as suggested by
size-exclusion results shown in Figure \ref{fig:sec_results}. The ultimate fate,
however, of the ATRA after it has bound to COMPcc is not clear, and its release may
be delayed when coupled to the stability of meso-scale assemblies such as
fibers. The formation of dense fibrous networks of COMPcc \latin{in vitro}, which
was not investigated in this study may also provide an alternative theory. The
mechanics of the micro-environment of the synovial space has been shown to
correlate with chondrocyte hypertrophy, particularly with respect to tissue
pressures induced by proteoglycans and collagen turnover.\cite{VanDonkelaar2012}
In this manner, COMPcc fibers, if dense enough, may be significantly altering the
mechanical properties of the culture micro-environment, thereby inhibiting
chondrocyte hypertrophy. Evidence of this is limited at this point, and would
require further studies into the microrheological properties of COMPcc fiber
networks and hetero-networks when applied to chondrocyte cultures.

\subsection{Insights into the molecular properties of COMPcc upon mixing with
BMS493}
\label{sec:discuss_binding}
% --------------------------
The data from Section \ref{sec:binding_mechanism}, along with preliminary
electron microscopy studies of COMPcc (see Section \ref{sec:comp_tem_results}),
has provided some evidence to construct a model of the mode of complexation
between COMPcc and BMS493. Null effects on both the secondary structure and
meso-scale assembly of the COMPcc by BMS493, indicate the protein still
readily forms alpha-helices and assembles into larger meso-scale
architectures, most likely akin to the fibers reported in Figure
\ref{fig:COMP_EM_3}. The formation of these larger fibers may account for the
evolution of the chromatographic profiles shown in Figure
\ref{fig:zonal_elution_report}; as larger fibrillar assemblies form within the
first few hours of incubation, COMPcc protein elutes from G-25 superfine media at
earlier retention times that approach the void volume of the column
configuration. This is exemplified in Figure \ref{fig:ze_retention_times} by the
change in peak retention time from ~\SI{2}{\mL} to ~\SI{1.5}{\mL}, with the latter
being the void volume of the HiTrap Desalting column used for this particular
study. UPLC-assisted size-exclusion offered insight into the supramolecular
assemblies that may be forming during this process as well as the binding states
of BMS493. Figure \ref{fig:sec_results} juxtaposes chromatographic separations of
COMPcc and COMPcc+BMS493, suggestive of an affinity of COMPcc to not only bind to
BMS493, but to be promoted from a tetrameric state to a pentameric state upon
exposure to BMS493. During this transformation, the protein maintains its
helical character, lending to the likelihood that the larger molecular species
is indeed a coiled-coil oligomer. Larger meso-scale fibrils were more likely to
have been filtered out during the sample preparation process for UPLC or
entrained in the column pre-filter.

Several questions remain unanswered regarding these data, the answers to which
may potentially impact the description of the aforementioned proposed model.
First, the increase in signal intensity of zonal elution profiles plotted in
Figure \ref{fig:ze_intensity} does not help explain this proposed model. Second,
the true concentration of soluble BMS493 in the mobile phase of these solution,
containing only \SI{10}{\volper} methanol or ethanol, remains unknown; while the
solution is prepared to \SI{50}{\micro\moLar}, the lack of signal yielded by
BMS493 control samples when injected onto a size-exclusion raises the
possibility of incomplete solubilization of BMS493. Regardless of these
outstanding questions, these results maintain a promise for (1) COMPcc to enhance
the therapeutic effects of BMS493 and potentially other RAR/RXR interfering
molecules and (2) a deeper understanding of the applicability of coiled-coils to
small-molecule encapsulation.

The assessment of binding affinities of COMPcc for BMS493 may most likely
require determination via equilibrium sedimentation experiments using an
analytical centrifuge. This is particularly the case as UPLC data has
demonstrated that BMS493 affects the oligomerization state of COMPcc. Thus, in
order to separate the synergistic effects of oligomerization and binding, which
would prove difficult via bulk analyses such as differential scanning
calorimetry or isothermal titration calorimetry, a method that allows separation
of species based on size and still maintains equilibrium conditions is desired.
Gunasekar has performed similar experiments on COMPcc
variants and other coiled-coil forming proteins.\cite{Gunasekar2009,Fletcher2012} 

\subsection{Meso-scale features of COMPcc promote intra-articular delivery
applications}
\label{sec:invivo_fate}
% --------------------------
The meso-scale assembly of COMPcc into fibers and fiber-bundles, while not the
primary focus of this work, situates the protein as an attractive formulation
component for intra-articular delivery.\cite{Gerwin2006} Similar to
microspheres and liposomes, COMPcc assemblies may be used to entrain small
molecule drugs within the synovium. As part of this fate, however, the COMPcc
protein would be exposed to a prevalence of macrophages in an osteoarthritic
disease model. This typically results in the phagocytosis of delivery agents by
residing macrophages in the synovial cavity,
followed by their subsequent degradation and release of encapsulated small
molecule. In the case of COMPcc fibers, if BMS493 is fully complexed within
pentamers, which then constitute the larger meso-scale fibrillar and larger
still fiber bundles, then the bottom-up assembly of these complexes may
facilitate a tiered degradation of the delivery agent and piece-meal release of
BMS493. Similar to the fate of \iupac{\D\L-}lactide/glycolide copolymer nano-
and micro-spheres studied by Horisawa,\cite{Horisawa2002} a downstream
hypothesis for the development of COMPcc would be its uptake by macrophages
existing in the epithelium synovial lining, and potentially transferring through
the cell-junctions into the underlying synovial tissues. In addition, the
endogenous proteases of macrophages may likely provide a method for enhanced
deconstruction of COMPcc fiber assemblies and subsequent release of BMS493.
Similar uses of fibers for drug delivery applications have become viable with
the advancements in electrospinning technology.\cite{Sill2008} Precedence indeed
exists for the formation of fibers with diameters ranging
\SIrange{200}{6000}{\nm}, for the diffusion- or degradation-driven delivery of
small molecules and macromolecules, including Paclitaxel,\ Mefoxin,
${\beta}$-nerve growth factor, and BSA.\cite{Liang2005,Chew2005,Xu2006a}

\subsection{Future work}
% --------------------------
\label{sec:future_work_endotoxin}
These preliminary results suggest that the COMPcc does not significantly improve
the therapeutic effects of BMS493. The signal from these experiments suffers,
however, from potential noise originating from the presence of endotoxins in the
sample, possibly eliciting similar catabolic gene expression to what is
observed. While dosage experiments were performed in this study of COMPcc and
COMPcc that had undergone endotoxin removal procedures, additional control
samples can improve the confidence of these results. While LPS have been shown
to induce catabolic gene expression, known standards of LPS may be administered
to chondrocytes in future studies to gauge actual response from a positive
control. In addition, purified lysate from non-transformed BL21 (DE3)
\latin{E.coli} that undergoes endotoxin removal procedures may be used and
considered as a negative control sample group toward the testing of COMPcc
alone.

\label{sec:future_work_ATRA_sequestration}
The possible ATRA sequestration activity of COMPcc, evidenced by the
down-regulation of hypertrophic gene marker type X collagen may be further
assessed against negative and positive controls. Measurement of type X collagen
in the presence of a static amount of COMPcc should demonstrate a lag in
dose-dependent effects of ATRA on OA markers. This can be tested against the
negative control of a COMPcc mutant shown to lack ${\alpha}$-helical secondary
structure as well as binding functionality, as previously found by
Gunasekar.\cite{Gunasekar2009} One such mutant is V47A, which demonstrated
\SI{19.2}{\percent} helical content and insignificant binding affinities toward
curcumin.\cite{Gunasekar2009}

The COMPcc protein, however, requires significantly more development, focused
primarily on the binding and release properties at both the molecular-scale and
mesoscopic scale, via techniques such as size-exclusion chromatography,
analytical ultracentrifugation and isothermal calorimetry. The use of
calorimetric measurements, however, to monitor tandem events of fiber
formation/degradation concurrent with small molecule binding/release may require
the development of sophisticated deconvolution schemes for data analysis. It
should be noted that isothermal calorimetry has been employed to monitor both
types of events in many instances in the preceding literature.\cite{Kardos2004}

Co-solvation also remains an unexplored parameter of the formulation
development; it was assumed constant at \SI{10}{\volper} methanol or ethanol for
this study, but it was apparent from both the application of zonal elution and
Hummel-Dreyer chromatography that BMS493 may only be partially soluble under
these conditions. A balance must be stricken between the solvation of BMS493 (or
any other hydrophobic/non-polar small molecule compound) and the (molecular and
meso-scale) structural integrity of the protein-based carrier.
