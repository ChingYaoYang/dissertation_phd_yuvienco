\subsection{Osteoarthritis}

\subsubsection{Pathology description}

Joint pain continues continues to plague the world's population, affecting an
estimated 27 million Americans alone and encumbering an economic burden of costs
(both direct and indirect) associated with osteoarthritis that exceeds \$60
billion annually.\cite{Brown} As cartilage demonstrates very little tendency for
self-repair, injuries and trauma can further lead to cartilage degeneration and
secondary arthritis, despite the best current care of significant joint
injuries.\cite{Helmerhorst2014} These include injuries to articular cartilage,
anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), and meniscus injuries, contributing to the
accumulated risk of post-traumatic osteoarthritis of
\SIrange{20}{50}{\percent}.\cite{Roos1995,Anderson2011,Reiersen1998,Buckwalter2006}

% --------------------------
As there is no cure for post-traumatic osteoarthritis, with existing treatments
limited to pain management, the most common outcome is the replacement of the
affected area with joint construction and implantation of a prosthesis. Highly
physically active individuals, such as professional athletes and military
service members, are of particularly higher risk to heightened osteoarthritis
progression.\cite{Cameron2011} Unfortunately, there is a dearth of biological
and chemical compounds available for the treatment of post-traumatic
osteoarthritis. Thus, there exists a potential need for early detection
strategies and therapeutic targets to slow onset and progression.

Cartilage in joints acts as a firm visco-elastic tissue, covering the ends of
bones and acting as a smooth, gliding matrix and as a cushion between bones,
shown in Figure \ref{fig:bone_diagram_1}. It is a biomaterial composed primarily
of collagen fibers and aggrecans (aggregating chondroitin sulphate
proteoglycans), fostered by chondrocyte cells. In healthy cartilage tissue,
articular chondrocytes maintain a stable phenotype, balancing anabolic and
catabolic events, which results in the equilibrium condition of controlled
synthesis and degradation of extracellular matrix components.\cite{Sandell2001}
It is the disturbance of this equilibrium that has been established to be the
mechanism by which osteoarthritis occurs physiologically, resulting in the 
net loss of extracellular matrix components key to cartilage function and
integrity. This has been attributed to both the lack of synthesis and increased
levels of proteases, but also has been ascribed to phenotypic changes in
articular chondrocytes, transitioning to a more hypertrophic
phenotype.\cite{Goldring2000,VanderKraan2012} The Kirsch \latin{et al.} have been amongst the first to
report the loss of this phenotype and execution of hypertrophic and terminal
differentiation events,\cite{Kirsch2000} and have been verified amongst many
other research groups.\cite{Tchetina2007,Merz2003,Pfander2001,Davies2009} 

\subsubsection{Biochemistry of osteoarthritis}

\subsubsection{The role of retinoids}

Retinoids, specifically, \iupac{all-\trans-retinoic acid} (ATRA), and its role
as a regulator of cartilage and skeletal formation has been
established.\cite{Koyama1999} Specifically, it has been shown that ATRA is a
very potent inducer of hypertrophic and terminal differentiation, as well as
specifically inducing the expression of certain matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)
and aggrecanases (ADAMTS), both predominantly responsible for the degradation of
the extracellular matrix at cartilage
sites.\cite{Wang2002,Iwamoto1994,Koyama1999,Johnson2003} These studies have
contributed to the ongoing hypothesis that increased ATRA levels in
osteoarthritis is a major contributor to osteoarthritis pathogenesis because of
ATRA's potential to induce hypertrophic differentiation, inflammatory activity,
increase protease expression, and perturb gene expression associated with
extracellular matrix components. Furthermore, Kirsch \latin{et al.} from New
York University Joint Disease Hospital have preliminary unpublished data
suggesting that ATRA stimulates catabolic events in articular chondrocytes and
further augments these events in the presence of catabolic cytokines, such as
interleukin-1-beta (IL-1${\beta}$).

The influence of ATRA and its analogues stems from their interactions with two
sub-families of nuclear receptor transcription factors involved in retinoid
signaling - retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and retinoid X receptors (RXRs). RARs
are further differentiated across three variants, RAR${\alpha}$, RAR${\beta}$, and
RAR${\gamma}$ receptors, all three of which are activated by ATRA.\cite{Chambon1996}
While growth plate chondrocytes are known to mainly express RAR${\alpha}$ and
RAR${\gamma}$,\cite{Koyama1999} little is known regarding the expression of RARs
amongst osteoarthritic and healthy articular chondrocytes. RARs and RXRs
interact with one another to form heterodimers, facilitating ligand-dependent
transcription with a myriad of discovered participating
cofactors.\cite{Altucci2007}

Retinoic acid receptors (RARs), have been at the forefront of attention with 

\subsection{Delivering small molecule therapeutics}

%\subsubsection{Hurdles in the delivery of therapeutics}

\subsubsection{Drug delivery vehicles}

In the development of biochemical therapeutics, bioavailability has long been a
defining functional benchmark for many innovations in the field. The bodies
reticuloendothelial system, responsible for the efficient clearance of foreign
small molecules, is unfortunately too efficient at its task at size-excluding
therapeutic small molecules for subsequent excretion via the kidneys.
Bioavailability can be a function of compound solubility, \latin{in vivo}
half-life, therapeutic index, and immunogenicity, which all can affect the
available quantity of compound for its intended
destination.\cite{Petros2010,Davis2008,Shah1992}

Stemming from the long-held small molecule chemistry approach to therapy development,
many of the breakthroughs in the development of molecular ``vehicles'' to
increase bioavailability pertain to small molecules, both hydrophobic and
hydrophilic. Nanoparticle-based drug delivery, in particular, has been
approached from multiple material chemistries, including liposome, polymer, and
protein-based delivery vehicles. Many of these particle-based technologies
leverage the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, characteristic of
the body's size-exclusive execretory process via its reticuloendothelial
system.\cite{Matsumura1986,Fang2010} The EPR effect is credited to the
physiologic nature of the vasculature of tumor tissue, which tends to be
``leakier'' than healthy tissue, allowing for the mass transfer of larger
particles through the endothelium than would normally be permitted. Furthermore,
the lymphatic drainage of tumor tissue is not capable of draining particles
larger than some permitted through the leaky endothelium, the result of which
is a size cutoff window that allows for accumulation of nanoparticles at a site
of cancerous tissue (Figure \ref{fig:EPR_effect}).

    \caption{Schematic of the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR)
    effect.}\label{fig:EPR_effect} \end{figure}

\subsubsection{Mechanisms and strategies for enhancement of delivery}
% --------------------------
Liposomes are poised as the most mature of the technologies, having been
successfully implemented to deliver various therapeutics stemming from their
ability to efficiently sequester small molecule
solutes.\cite{Ranson1996,Sessa1968,Bangham1965,Bangham1974} The potential for
delivery of anti-cancer therapeutics has been pursued since the early
1970's.\cite{Gregoriadis1974} They have particularly been successful in
increasing the bioavailability of anti-cancer therapeutics, such as doxorubicin
and curcumin, whilst having matured to take on forms allowing more advanced
passive and active targeting strategies.\cite{Al-Jamal2012,Huang1994,Li2007}

In addition, polymer-based micelles have also been developed, such as those
consisting of \iupac{poly-(lactic-\co-glycolic) acid} (PLGA) for the
encapsulation of small molecules, including curcumin and
\iupac{all-\trans-retinoic acid}.\cite{Li2009,Yallapu2010b} This strategy has
shown to produce drug encapsulation efficiencies of up to \SI{90}{\percent},
dramatically improving the solubility of, for example, a highly water insoluble molecule
such as curcumin. An example of typical formulation strategy is exemplified in
the work by Yallapu \latin{et al.}, shown in Figure
\ref{fig:PLA_curcumin_example}.\cite{Yallapu2010b}

ATRA-loaded micelle-like nanoparticles, developed by Nagai \latin{et
al.}\cite{Li2009} improving the half-life of ATRA as compared to an injection of
free ATRA solution.

to a therapeutic RAR agonist and/or antagonist to demonstrate the feasibility of
non-covalently storing such hydrophobic molecules for long-term delivery.
